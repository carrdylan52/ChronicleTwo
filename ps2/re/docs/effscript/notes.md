# effscript: reverse-engineering notes

`CEffectScriptMan::BuildBase(int, ...)` and `AssignCharacter` are accepted
native C++ callers with one scoped `CCharacter2` placement row each.
`CreateEffSpt` and `SetCharacter` are the only remaining guarded functions.
See [placement conversion](../satansfiddle/placement-new.md).

Effect script manager. No counterpart in the first game's decompilation (nothing named
EffectScript / EFF_SCRIPT / ES_SPRITE there).

## Types not named by retail
Retail names come only from mangled symbols: `CEffectScriptMan`, `_EFF_SCRIPT`, `_ES_SPRITE`.
These are neutral names chosen here: `EFF_SPT_BASE_DEF` (definition table row), `EFF_SPT_BASE`
(loaded base, 0x1C), `EFF_SPT_VALUE` (int/float union), enums `EffSptBaseType`, `EffSptState`.

## CEffectScriptMan (0x1190)
Size: `__nw__FUiP1(0x1190, ...)` in InitDungeonMain (dng_main) and EditInit (editloop). No
out-of-line ctor: the inline ctor runs the mgC3DSprite ctor on +0x30 (vtable stored at +0x4C)
then `Initialize(NULL, -1, -1)`. No vtable of its own.

| 0x1188/0x118C | head/tail | doubly linked list via _EFF_SCRIPT prev/next (0x140/0x144) |

List is ordered ascending by `_EFF_SCRIPT::texb` (insertion in CreateEffSpt).

## Globals
- `eff_spt_base_def` global .data (above). `now_scene` (.sbss, CScene*, = GetMainScene() in
  Initialize). `EffScriptMan` (.sbss, CEffectScriptMan*, set in Step) global.
- Local (not in header): `now_script` (_EFF_SCRIPT* being stepped), `ext_func__4` (0x400 = 256
  function pointers, passed to CRunScript::ext_func with 0x100), `ext_func_info__4` (0x408 =
  0x81 RS_EXTFUNC_INFO rows, see runscript_opcodes.hpp).
- All non-member functions (GetEffSptBaseDefPtr, DrawEffSptSprite, GetSpritePtr, GetStack*,
  SetStack*, every `_XXX(RS_STACKDATA*, int)` script function, SetEffectScript,
  SetEffectScriptFunc) are LOCAL in retail: define them `static` in the .cpp.

## Signatures / return types
- `P1` in the mangled names is `u_long128 *` (as in mgCMemory::stSetBuffer), so BuildBase takes
  (int, u_long128*, int, u_long128*, int, mgCMemory*, int); Ghidra/m2c drop the last two (t2/t3).
- Return values used by callers: LoadBaseEffSpt(char*) and BuildPack(char*) -> int,
  GetBaseChara(char*) -> CCharacter2*. BuildBase(char*) and GetNeedFilePath(char*) have no
  caller that reads the result: int assumed (marked @unknownret).
- ClearBaseFromLevel: m2c says void (Ghidra's int is a leftover register).
- CCharacter2 vtable slots used: +0xEC Copy(CCharacter2&, mgCMemory*), +0xF0 GetCopySize,
  +0xD4 (per-step update), +0x10 SetPosition, +0x18 GetPosition, +0x38 draw, +0x54 show.

## Native C++ calls

`CEffectScriptMan::DeleteEffSpt` releases the collision primitive through `CColPrim::Delete(owner)` and frees the three owned `u_long128*` blocks with `mgCMemory::Free`, ending with the work block. `AssignSprite` obtains its array storage with `mgCMemory::Alloc` before placement array construction. Direct typed member calls reproduce the retail code.

The local stack access helpers are ordinary C++ static functions. The two `SetStack` overloads write through reference slots only when `RS_STACKDATA::type == 3`. Retail symbol listings append numeric suffixes where same-named local helpers occur in earlier units; their instruction bodies are identical to the unsuffixed native C++ object functions apart from relocated branch addresses.

`CEffectScriptMan::SetCharacter` reaches `slot[group][slot]` at offset 0x184. Native two-dimensional indexing preserves the address but MWCC reverses both commutative `addu` operands (99.88%); staging the row first leaves one reversed `addu` (99.94%). Typed pointer and flat indexing variants were also tested and did not reproduce retail operand order, so the byte-offset expression remains pending an exact typed form. This function remains a `NONMATCHING` C++ draft with an active `INCLUDE_ASM` fallback. Four sprite-command stack advances likewise changed scheduling when written as `stack += n` or `&stack[n]`; their byte-address forms remain pending.

Earlier `CreateEffSpt` forms constructed the `CRunScript` member at +0x50
after raw `_EFF_SCRIPT` allocation. Member placement through the project
overload added an `operator new` call (98.11%); an inline void-pointer
overload added a second null check (98.13%). Whole-object construction scored
97.20%, so that older source retained the explicit constructor symbol. The
current guarded draft constructs the whole `_EFF_SCRIPT` naturally, as
recorded below.

An inline placement overload taking `CRunScript*` or `CRunScript&` still emits
an extra null branch before the native constructor call (98.125%). Native
placement construction of `_EFF_SCRIPT` shifts the branch and long-lived
register assignments (97.203%). Splitting allocation from construction adds
another guard (94.25%). These earlier forms preserved construction semantics
but failed retail matching, so that source/profile boundary retained the
original call.

MWCC 3.0 accepts `script->run.CRunScript()` as source, but it constructs a
temporary at a stack address instead of the `run` member; the result is both
semantically wrong and only 98.45% matching. The compiler's `-help` exposes
no option to suppress the placement-new null guard. The native member form
adds a branch and delay-slot instruction in the middle of `CreateEffSpt`, so
relocation rebinding alone cannot restore the retail instruction stream.

The script's local `GetStackString` returns the pointer stored in a stack
slot. Typing its return as `char*` removes the integer-to-pointer casts at
its call sites; all affected functions remain exact.

A direct native allocation, `script = new (work_memory->Alloc(0x17)) _EFF_SCRIPT`,
constructs the `CRunScript` member and preserves the 0x500-byte function size,
but scores 97.20%. At the allocation site it puts `beqz v0` before the move
into the saved script register, while retail moves first and branches on that
register. It places the constructor argument in the call delay slot; retail
places it in the branch delay slot and leaves the call delay slot empty. The
new expression also swaps the saved registers used for the script and work
token through the rest of `CreateEffSpt`. The original explicit call restored
100% in that older comparison. This rejected-form result predates the current
whole-object natural-construction draft.
## Pending code matches

`_INTERSECTION_POINT` tests a segment against scene collision polygons and returns the hit
index, position, reflection, area kind, and footstep sound according to its argument count.
Its native C++ function passes the full linked-image comparison. Array indexing through the
polygon cursor preserves retail register allocation; indexing from the original local array
changes it.
## Constructor call cleanup

All four constructor callers use natural typed allocation. `BuildBase(int, ...)`
and `AssignCharacter` are native with the scoped compiler conversion.
`CreateEffSpt(int, int, int)` and `SetCharacter` retain `NONMATCHING` drafts
and retail assembly bodies. The former constructs the whole `_EFF_SCRIPT`,
including its `CRunScript` member, and uses the named `RS_STACKDATA::val`
union and `CMap::map_info` fields. Its natural draft is still nonmatching.

## Earlier constructor schedules

Before scoped conversion, `AssignCharacter` and `BuildBase(int, ...)` each
differed by two words with the pinned profile. At +0xB4/+0xB8 and
+0x258/+0x25C respectively, retail tested operator-new's v0 result and copied
to s2 in the branch delay slot; the candidate copied first and tested s2.
The natural character constructors accounted for the other initialization.
Those baseline forms were parked without constructor/header changes; both
callers now have accepted native bodies.

The following measurements document the earlier forms of the two functions
that remain guarded.

`SetCharacter` differs by 24/168 words, body 0x29C within retail 0x2A0.
Both allocation paths exhibit the same null-test issue. In the registered
path the compiler also exchanges the saved entry and character registers
through initialization and copy. Storing the new-expression straight into
the character member does not resolve this. Its existing guarded source
remains pending a natural table-index form and allocation-result schedule.
Reconsider when placement lowering is understood and a typed indexing form
preserves the entry lifetime.

`CreateEffSpt` constructs the whole `_EFF_SCRIPT` through its natural
new-expression; the compiler constructs its `CRunScript` member at +0x50.
The native draft is 0x500 bytes, retail's extent, and differs in 206/320
words, closer than the previous 0x510-byte draft's 224/324 side-by-side
words. The prior explicit operator-new plus member placement-new added an
extra allocator call and null branch. The retained whole-object form still
changes allocation-result branch placement and saved script/work-token
registers, and its character allocation also has the known null-test
remainder. It remains guarded. Reconsider with an admissible whole-object
constructor schedule; explicit constructor calls or dummy wrappers are not
solutions.
