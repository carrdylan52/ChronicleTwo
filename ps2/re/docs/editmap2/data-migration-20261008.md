# editmap2 data migration (2026-10-08)

Baseline: `d56248a7`; 8 `INCLUDE_RODATA` / 3
`INCLUDE_BSS` markers; matched_data 0/123.

## Native initializers and literals

`GroundBalance` already declares four zero-initialized integer weights and
uses the four retail model-name literals. Removing their five markers leaves
its object unchanged (`editmap2-native-ground-pieces`). The zero template is
compiler-generated initializer storage, rather than a persistent game state.

The river branch of `GetePlacePartsAtInfoID` now initializes its actual
`sceVu0FVECTOR` as `{0, 0, 0, -1}` and passes that vector directly to
`GetRiverNum`. This removes the union view, quadword type-pun, external
initializer and marker (`editmap2-river-position`).

`UpdateHouse` uses the inline decimal suffix format and `npclive` prefix,
and includes `mainloop.hpp` for `LanguageCode` instead of redeclaring it.
The ten-byte `NpcLiveName` aggregate is initialized with `"npclive"` inside
the model loop, where retail copies its initializer. Declaring its actual
suffix buffer immediately afterward preserves the existing stack order.
The initializer has eight meaningful string bytes, two trailing zero bytes,
and six piece-alignment bytes (`editmap2-npc-name-literals`,
`editmap2-npc-name-template`).

## Retained compiler-generated counter identities

`CheckEditParts` already has the natural function-local `static int cnt = 0`.
Removing `cnt_482` and `init_483` markers passes the full PAL verifier but
fails canonical object comparison: MWCC emits `cnt_185` and `init_186`, and
the mapper binds those compiler suffixes only when the retail markers are
retained. The guarded initialization and counter instructions match; no
manual initialization guard is introduced. Both markers remain pending a
shared mapper change (`editmap2-native-counter-guard`,
`editmap2-counter-guard-failed-objects`).

The exact private shared-tool proposal is
`.private/proposals/dataE-named-local-bss.patch`. It extends the existing
anonymous-BSS matcher to numeric-suffixed LOCAL names, requiring matching
source bases, declared sizes, section kinds, and consistent opcode-checked
code references. The native guard is one byte, with three bytes of trailing
piece alignment. A copied marker-free object passes all bytes and 143
resolved relocations (`named-local-bss-proposal-objects.log`). Negative
checks reject absent references, a different base name, GLOBAL storage, and
a conflicting reference (`named-local-bss-proposal-check.log`). The shared
script is unchanged; full tool integration remains with the tooling lane.

The corrected graph and named-BSS proposals pass the complete comparator
on copies of all 149 objects, including marker-free mapsky/editmap2 and
the native texture-workspace copy (`combined-mapper-proposals-objects.log`).
Retail, symbol, and piece inputs are shared immutably through the existing
explicit function parameters, retaining separate default-reference and
no-reference piece contexts. The actual canonical scripts and objects are
unchanged; linked PAL acceptance of tooling integration remains with the
tooling lane.

Final: 0 rodata / 2 BSS markers; matched_data
118/123 after the standard objdiff/progress refresh.
Every accepted step passes the full PAL build (`SCES_511.90: OK`) and
all 149 complete objects, including resolved relocations. The 148 other
object hashes are unchanged at each step. Function coverage stays
6,770 matched / 93 guarded / nine assembly-only / zero fuzzy.

Validation receipts are under `.private/dataE/`, with the step prefixes
listed above and `-build.log`, `-objects.log`, and `-hashes.log` suffixes.
Final refresh: `editmap2-final-progress.log`, `editmap2-final-coverage.log`,
and `editmap2-final-metrics.json`.
