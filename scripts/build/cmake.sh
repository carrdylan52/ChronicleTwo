# CMakeCache.txt records the absolute source directory it was generated for,
# and the build tree is shared between contexts that see the tree at different
# paths (the dev container, the devcontainer, a host checkout), so a cache from
# one makes cmake refuse to run under another -- `cmake --build` included,
# since it re-runs configure through build.ninja. That is why nothing else
# calls cmake. `--fresh` fixes it but discards a good cache, so it is used only
# when the recorded source directory differs, or when configure fails.
