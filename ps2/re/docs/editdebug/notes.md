# editdebug notes

Town-building (georama) debug menu and lighting editor. Called from `editloop`: `EditInit` calls
`EditDebugInit`/`InitLightingEdit`; `EditLoop` (only when `DebugFlag != 0`) calls
`EditDebugMode`, `EditDebugLoop(MainScene, &EdDebugInfo)`, `EditDebugStart(0xD7, &MenuBuffer)`
(on pad 0x400) and `LightingEdit(MainScene)` every frame. No first-game counterpart (nothing named
EditDebug/LightingEdit/SubGameInfo in `/home/adubbz/development/chronicle`).

The unit owns no classes (`class_units.tsv` has none). Header declares `EditDebugInfo` and enums.

## Data (all LOCAL in retail -> `static` in the .cpp; no externs in the header)
`.data`: `SelMax` int[3] (0xC) = {7,5,2}; `SelData` int*[3][8] (0x60) = value each entry edits
(page0: `&DebugInfo[0]`, `&EventNo`, `&DebugInfo[2]`, `&DebugInfo[1]`, `&sg_type`, `&DebugInfo[3]`,
`&DebugInfo[4]`; page1: NULL, `&save_no`, `&load_no`, `&condition`, `&map_flag_no`; page2: `&map_jump`);
`SelText` char*[3][8] entry labels; `SelHelp` char*[3][8] help lines (page0 entry1 "○:run ▲:reload" (Shift-JIS),
entry3 "1:sp up 2:col off", rest ""); `LightSel` int[4] current row per lighting page;
`LightListNum` int[4] = {11,8,9,3} rows per lighting page. `.sdata`: `EventNo` int = 100.
`.sbss`: `EditDebugFlag`, `EditDebugTexb` (texture bank, -1 none, 0xD7 from EditLoop), `Select`
(row), `SelTAG` (page, EDIT_DEBUG_PAGE), `sg_type`, `map_jump`, `save_no`, `load_no`, `condition`,
`map_flag_no`, `LEditFlag`, `LightType` (LIGHTING_EDIT_PAGE), `DirLightNo` (0..), `fish_num`; all int.
`.bss at_1237` 0x10 is a function-local static of LightingEdit.

Values edited via `SelData` are clamped 0..99999; pad: 0x8000/0x2000 ±1, 4/8 ±10 (±10000 with
pads 1+2 held), 1/2 ±100; 0x100 next page; 0x4000/0x1000 next/prev row; 0x20 act; 0x10 alt-act.
After editing, `DebugInfo` words are clamped: [0],[2],[3] -> bool, [1] 0..2, [4] 0..1
(`DebugInfo` is a global int[5] at 0x3FAF30 owned elsewhere).

## Enums (values from SelText strings and EditDebugLoop's `SelTAG`/`Select` tests)
- `EDIT_DEBUG_PAGE`: 0 general ("Debug Camera","RunEvent","Georama Debug","CharaMove","SubGame",
  "ParamOff","InventDebug"), 1 edit data ("All Clear","Save File","Load File","Con","Map Flag"),
  2 map ("Map Jump","Load Gyorace"). `SelTAG` wraps after 2.
- Actions on 0x20: page0 row4 -> `sgInitSubGame(sg_type, info)` + `EditDebugEnd`; page0 row1 ->
  `CScene::RunEvent(EventNo, NULL)` (0x10 -> `ReloadMapScript`); page1 row0 `CEditMap::ClearAllParts`,
  row1 save `host0:geo_data/geo%d-%d.edt` (`WriteFile(..., info->edit_data, 0x5510)`), row2 load
  (`LoadFile2` into `info->edit_data`, then `EditDataLoad`), row3 toggle
  `CEditData::dbgSet/GetContintionFlag(edit_data_no, condition)` (0x10 toggles all 0x40), row4
  toggle `CMapFlagData::SetFlag(map_flag_no)`; page2 row0 `info->jump_map_no = map_jump` and close,
  row1 `LoadGyorace()`. Item enums: `EDIT_DEBUG_GENERAL_ITEM`, `EDIT_DEBUG_EDIT_DATA_ITEM`,
  `EDIT_DEBUG_MAP_ITEM` (names derived from the label strings).
- `LIGHTING_EDIT_PAGE` from `at_1231` labels: 0 "BG & AMB", 1 "Dir Light" (prints `DirLightNo`),
  2 "Fog" (NEAR/FAR/R/G/B/MIN/MAX), 3 "File" (save to `%sy:/dc2/build/light_info/%s.lgt`, prefix "host:").

## EditDebugInfo (size 0x3C)
Size from the `EdDebugInfo` global (editloop, 0x1ECDA20, size 0x3C).
- 0x00..0x2F: a `SubGameInfo`. Evidence: `EditDebugLoop` passes the pointer unchanged to
  `sgInitSubGame(int, SubGameInfo*)`, which reads 0x00 and 0x0C..0x2C; `__sinit_editloop_cpp` zeroes
  exactly +0x00,+0x10,+0x14,+0x18,+0x1C,+0x28,+0x2C of `EdDebugInfo`, the same set
  `__sinit_subgame_cpp` zeroes on `GameInfo` -> an inline `SubGameInfo` constructor. +0x00 is a
  `CScene*` (EditInit stores MainScene; fishing derefs it as CScene). EditInit also sets +0x04=0xB9,
  +0x08=0x15, +0x0C=0x9A, +0x20/+0x24 = same register value.
  Declared as a base class (`struct EditDebugInfo : public SubGameInfo`); a first member would
  compile identically. `SubGameInfo` belongs to `subgame`; `subgame.hpp` declares its 0x30-byte
  layout, and the size assertion for `EditDebugInfo` passes in the PS2 build.
- 0x30 `CEditData* edit_data`: set by `EditMapJump` = `CSaveData::GetEditData(n)`; NULL check and
  `dbgGetContintionFlag` this; save/load buffer (0x5510 bytes).
- 0x34 `int edit_data_no`: the `n` above (0..3 by town map), passed to `dbg*ContintionFlag`.
- 0x38 `int jump_map_no`: set from `map_jump`; EditInit sets -1; EditLoop calls
  `EditMapJump(jump_map_no)` when >= 0 and resets to -1.

## Earlier draft snapshot
All ten previously assembly-only named functions have C++ implementations.
`EditDebugInit`, `EditDebugMode`, `EditDebugStart`, `PrintCursor`,
`InitLightingEdit`, and `IsLightingEditMode` pass isolated linked-image
verification and are promoted. The four other drafts compile behind
`NONMATCHING`; their retail assembly remains the default. Their isolated
differences are `EditDebugLoop` 649/692 words, `LightingEdit` 1314/1356 words,
`tagGyoFish` 56/72 words, and `LoadGyorace` 2/32 words. Each received one
promotion attempt. The `tagGyoFish` attempt initially failed to link because
its C++ declaration was file-static while the retained `at_1542` assembly table
relocates against the named symbol. The draft now has external C++ linkage,
but the ledger prevents a second attempt this pass. m2c could not resolve the
`LightingEdit` jump table; its existing Ghidra export and the retail assembly
were used to establish the page and control flow after the m2c pass.

## LightingEdit on the 73f8e75 merged base

`LightingEdit__FP6CScene` is the unit's only guarded function. With the pinned
Satan's Fiddle profile, the entry draft has 46 differing words out of 1,356
(the plain-wibo draft helper reports 60). Four named projected endpoint arrays
and a two-dimension coordinate adjustment loop reproduce retail's endpoint
lifetimes. A single indexed matrix retains axis addresses across projection
calls and differs by 53 words. The named-array version has zero differing
words and identical relocation fields; its native body is 0x1524 bytes against
the 0x1530 retail extent, whose remaining bytes are zero padding.

The absolute value of the projected Y axis is a conditional expression. This
removes the non-retail `LightAbs` wrapper. An in-place `if` instead changes the
branch delay slot at function offsets 0x122C/0x1230. The projection declaration
comes from its owning `mglib.hpp` header. The BG/ambient, Fog and File page
labels include retail's trailing arrows; omitting them passes the instruction
comparison but fails canonical data binding at retail 0x0036A850 (`at_1230`).

A temporary, manually unguarded canonical compile with the wrapper and section
fixup passes the complete unit: 0x296C allocated bytes and 668 resolved
relocations. This is a matching candidate, but the assembly guard remains:
the inherited fog-channel expression still converts the object address to an
integer and adds the raw byte offset 6. Promotion must also satisfy the lane's
natural-source rule.

The proposed shared-header change overlays `mgFOG_PARAM::r/g/b/a` at offsets
8..11 with `u_char color[4]`, retaining sizeof 0x30. Typed access
`&fog->color[edit - 2]` adds an instruction at offset 0x79C, moving subsequent
code by four bytes and producing 873 differing words. Signed and unsigned edit
indices both do this. The proposal was tested privately and reverted; it is
layout evidence, not an accepted matching patch. No profile row is needed for
the zero-word candidate; the existing TU helper-mask row accounts for the 14
extra differences seen with plain wibo.

**Park category:** source compliance/shared layout. **Reconsider when:** an
approved fog-channel representation permits indexed C++ access without the
extra subtraction instruction, followed by a zero-word and whole-unit check.
The rest of the function's control flow, strings, locals and expressions have
matching evidence.

Local evidence is in `.private/receipts/bigfn-drafts/editdebug-final.log` and
`.private/receipts/bigfn-editdebug/final-probe/check.log`; the exact shared-header
proposal is `.private/bigfn/mg_drawenv-color-proposal.patch`. The final guarded
build comparison is `.private/receipts/bigfn-final/`.

Final guarded validation is identical to i9 in verifier, complete object-check
output and coverage. All three lane units pass; the inherited failing set stays
mg_texture, nd_meswin, actionchara and actscript (145/149 pass). Coverage stays
6,666 matched / 184 guarded / 15 assembly-only / 7 fuzzy. No target is promoted.
Comparison receipt: `.private/receipts/bigfn-final/comparison.json`.

## Nearmiss fog representation audit

The current read-only DC1 checkout has no `mg_drawenv` unit or `mgFOG_PARAM`.
Its `EDIT_FOG_INFO` in `ps2/include/editloop.hpp` places near/far floats at
0/4, RGB at 8/9/10, and an unknown byte at 11. `EdSetLightParam` in
`ps2/src/editloop3.cpp` interpolates those fields and calls `MGSetFogParm`;
DC1's renderer keeps them in `RenderInfo`. Neither supplies an editor colour
array beginning at byte 6. DC2's retail switch uses `edit = row - 2`, merges
items 2/3/4, and then performs `edit + fog`, followed by byte offset 6.
The switch data is a branch-target table, not a table of field addresses.

A private three-channel RGB overlay, keeping alpha separate, still adds the
index subtraction at +0x79C and differs by 873/1356 words. Selecting the three
actual typed field addresses with a conditional expression adds branches and
emits 0x1548 bytes, exceeding retail's 0x1530 extent. Both are reverted. A
colour array starting at byte 6 would cover part of `far_dist`; it is not an
evidenced colour representation. Packed int/short access also lacks evidence
for retail's byte load/store sequence.

The original zero-word candidate remains guarded because its integer/byte
address arithmetic remains noncompliant. No shared header is changed. A new
promotion requires a genuine typed layout/index expression that folds the
colour offset without an extra operation, then the whole-unit check and the
required hashes of all other game objects if the shared header changes.
Receipts: `.private/receipts/nearmiss-probes/editdebug/n1/` and `n2/`; the RGB
header proposal existed only in a private include-tree copy.

## Mid-day typed-colour expression bounds (October 8)

The inherited raw-address `LightingEdit` draft still has zero differing words
and passes the canonical complete object (0x296C bytes, 668 relocations), but
remains guarded for source compliance. Its 0x1524 native body has twelve zero
padding bytes within the 0x1530 extent.

A private `mgFOG_PARAM` union overlays the existing RGBA byte fields with
`u_char color[4]`. MWCC compile-time assertions verify sizeof 0x30, the array
and red field at offset 8, green at 9, blue at 10 and alpha at 11. The exact
layout-only proposal is `.private/proposals/mg_drawenv-fog-color-array.patch`;
no shared header is modified or committed.

Strict subscript access, either `&fog->color[row - 4]` or a reference to
`fog->color[edit - 2]`, still emits one extra index subtraction and differs by
873/1356 words with a 0x1528 body. Carrying a separate colour index and forming
the switch index from it gives 915; switching on `edit - 2` while keeping the
unbiased row gives 945. No variant passes the whole-unit check.

A diagnostic typed-array pointer expression, `fog->color + edit - 2`, folds
the rebase into the two retail +6 memory/address displacements, leaving only
one differing instruction at +0x79C: `addu v0,s2,s1` instead of retail
`addu v0,s1,s2`. Integer-first source spelling does not reverse the compiler's
operand order. This diagnostic still uses explicit pointer arithmetic and is
not retained or proposed as an active compliant body. An index-first subtraction
returns to the 873-word result. The array never begins inside `far_dist`.

Promotion remains blocked by the typed access/code-generation problem. The
shared union proposal is only layout evidence, not a matching solution; its
all-unit effects have not been validated. The installed source/header/profile
are unchanged. Receipts: `.private/midday/probes/editdebug/`, including
`color-row/` for the layout assertions, `color-base-index/` for the one-word
bound and `baseline/` for the inherited complete-object match. The required
m2c attempt is saved under `.private/midday/m2c/`; its existing jump-table
limitation remains, so the documented retail switch disassembly supplies the
case analysis.

`LightingEdit` is now native matched C++. The Promotion section of
[night-20261008.md](night-20261008.md) supersedes the blocker above. It reaches
`GetLightingInfo` and `OutputLightData` through `map->map_info` (CMap's first
member) and names its pages with `LIGHTING_EDIT_PAGE`; both forms compile to
the same object.
