# convviewlp: reverse-engineering notes

## Constructor table ownership

The native `DataBuffer__3` and `Stack_ReadBuff__3` globals emit the retail
initializer and its constructor-table pointer. Retaining the old
`D_0037B0A0__DATA` placeholder duplicates that pointer. Removing only the
placeholder gives a canonical whole-unit pass (0x16B4 bytes, 338 relocations)
with the conversion-loop fallback still selected. The initializer's two
`mgCMemory::Init` calls were verified through `decompile.sh`.

Main-loop mode `LOOP_SV_CONV_VIEW` (9) in `mainloop.hpp`: a "SaveData Convert" screen that
renames North American (`BASCUS-97213...`) memory card save directories to this release's
`BESCES-51190...` names. No first-game counterpart. The unit owns no classes
(`class_units.tsv` has none for it).

## Functions
| Function | Linkage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SVConvViewInit(INIT_LOOP_ARG)` | global | `LoopInit[9]`. Header. |
| `SVConvViewExit()` | global | `LoopExit[9]`. `sceMcEnd`, `GamePad__2.AutoRepeatOff/MenuModeOff`, `sndSeAllStop(-1)`, `mgCloseFont`. Header. |
| `SVConvViewLoop()` | global | `LoopMain[9]`, returns `int` (1 = leave mode). Header. |
| `InitSaveFileInfoTablePtr()` | LOCAL (`local_symbols.tsv`) | `static void` in the .cpp, not in the header. Called from Init and Loop. |
| `SaveDataConvertLoop()` | global | Returns `int` (1 = finished/failed, 0 = continue). Header. |
| `__sinit_convviewlp_cpp` | compiler | Runs `mgCMemory::Init` on `DataBuffer` and `Stack_ReadBuff` (so both are by-value `mgCMemory` statics with a constructor). |

## Globals (all file-local; none go in the header)
Every data symbol of the unit is LOCAL in retail (`local_symbols.tsv`), so they are `static` in
the .cpp. Retail names (main.symbols.txt adds `__2`/`__3` to disambiguate same-named locals of
other units):
| Symbol | Addr | Size | Type / meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MovieScene` (`MovieScene__2`) | 0x37EA70 | 4 | `CScene*` from `GetMainScene()`; Init calls its object at +0x10548's vtable slot +8 (same pattern as movieviewlp). |
| `ConvMode` | 0x37EA74 | 4 | `int`, `SV_CONV_MODE` (0 select, 2 convert, 3 result; 1 never used). |
| `SlotSelect` | 0x37EA78 | 4 | `int`, memory card port passed to every `sceMc*` call (0/1, set by Left/Right). |
| `FileListNum` | 0x37EA7C | 4 | `int`, number of entries copied into `SaveFileInfoTablePtr`. |
| `ConvertPhase` | 0x37EA80 | 4 | `int`, `SAVEDATA_CONVERT_PHASE`. |
| `ConvertFileNum` | 0x37EA84 | 4 | `int`, directories renamed. |
| `ConvertResult` | 0x37EA88 | 4 | `int`, `SAVEDATA_CONVERT_RESULT` (0, 1, 100, 101). |
| `ConvertResultDispTime` | 0x37EA8C | 0x34 extent | `int` (only 4-byte accesses; set to 0x1E in convert mode, 0 on reset). Extent runs to the next symbol; the rest is probably alignment/unnamed padding -- unresolved. |
| `SaveFileInfoTablePtr` | 0x37EAC0 | 4 | `sceMcTblGetDir*` (0x40-byte entries): `new[]` of 0x800 bytes (32 entries) from the main stack; `memcpy` of 0x40 per entry; `EntryName` at +0x20 is cleared/compared/printed. NB: the copy loop allows up to 0x40 entries although only 32 fit. `sceMcTblGetDir` is not declared in `ps2/include/sce/libmc.h` yet (`sceMcGetDir` takes `void*`). |
| `SAVEDATA_BUFFER` | 0x37EAC4 | 4 | Pointer to a 0x659C0-byte object (`operator new(0x659c0, Alloc(0x659e))`); constructs 5 x `CEditData` (stride 0x5510) at +0x1CA4..+0x1C5F4, `CUserDataManager` at +0x1D320, `CQuestData::Initialize` at +0x62AC0, `CMenuSystemData` at +0x64140. Identical allocation is in `CMemoryCardManager::Initialize` (memcard, stored at +0x8EC). `CSaveData::GetEditData` uses edit data at +0x1C24, so this object likely holds a `CSaveData` at +0x80 -- type unresolved; owned by memcard/savedata. Only written here. |
| `init_817/820/823/826` | 0x37EAC8.. | 1 each | function-local static guard flags (compiler-generated) for `buf0`, `buf1`, `dbuf0`, `dbuf1`. |
| `DataBuffer` (`__3`) | 0x1F646B0 | 0x30 | `mgCMemory`, 100000-byte texture/data buffer, passed to `SetTextureTable(100, 0x14, ...)`. |
| `Stack_ReadBuff` (`__3`) | 0x1F646E0 | 0x30 | `mgCMemory`, set to the main stack's free space after Init; fields +0x14/+0x1C zeroed directly (`DAT_01f646fc`, `DAT_01f64704`). |
| `SaveFileInfoTableSizeConvert` | 0x1F64710 | 0x200 | `int[0x80]`? Only the first 0x20 ints (0x80 bytes) are zeroed by `InitSaveFileInfoTablePtr`; extent is 0x200 -> `int[0x80]` fits. Never read in this unit. |
| `buf0/buf1` (816/819) | 0x1F64910/40 | 0x30 | function-local static `mgCMemory` packet buffers (30000 bytes each) in Init. |
| `dbuf0/dbuf1` (822/825) | 0x1F64970/A0 | 0x30 | function-local static `mgCMemory` data buffers (60000 bytes each) in Init. |

`GamePad__2` (0x3FA5A0, size 0x478) is the global `CGamePad` object referenced by Exit/Loop; it is
a different symbol from mainloop's `GamePad` (0x37CF44, a 4-byte pointer?) -- check which header
declares the object before writing bodies.

## Enums (declared in convviewlp.hpp; names are descriptive, not retail)
- `SV_CONV_MODE`: transitions in `SVConvViewLoop`: 0 -(Cross 0x40)-> 2 (calls
  `InitSaveFileInfoTablePtr`); 2 -(SaveDataConvertLoop()!=0)-> 3; 3 -(Circle 0x20)-> 0, clearing
  result/time. In mode 0, Start (0x800) or Triangle (0x10) returns 1. Left 0x8000 -> slot 0,
  Right 0x2000 -> slot 1. (On-screen text says "Check & Convert:(O)" / "Return to SlotSelect :(X)",
  i.e. labels are swapped relative to the raw bits.) Use `PadButton` from gamepad.hpp.
- `SAVEDATA_CONVERT_PHASE`: 0 `sceMcGetInfo`: requires type==2 (PS2 card) and format==1, and
  sync result >= -1, else result 100; 1 `sceMcGetDir("BASCUS-97213*")`, result 101 if none;
  2 per entry convert, then phase 3 / result 1.
- `SAVEDATA_CONVERT_RESULT`: 100 "Failed Access memory card(PS2)", 101 "Not Exist Convert Files".
- `SAVEDATA_CONVERT_TYPE`: from `strncmp(EntryName + 0xC, ...)`: "dkcl" (4) -> 0, "dc2album" (8)
  -> 1, "dc2omake" (8) -> 2, else -1 (prints "not convert type"). For type 0, the number at
  `EntryName + 0x10` (`atoi`) is compared against existing `BESCES-51190*` dkcl numbers to skip
  duplicates ("error already exist ... convert no").

## SaveDataConvertLoop locals / rodata
- Three 0x80-byte `char[128]` locals initialised from rodata arrays `at_1072` ("BESCES-51190dkcl%d"),
  `at_1073` ("BESCES-51190dc2album"), `at_1074` ("BESCES-51190dc2omake"; extent 0xC0) -- copied
  as 4x0x20-byte blocks, i.e. `char name[128] = "..."` local arrays.
- A 0x1000-byte `sceMcTblGetDir[64]` buffer, a `char[64][128]` name table, an `int[64]` number
  table filled with -1 (0x20 when the suffix is empty), `char[128]` path buffers.
- Rename: `sceMcChdir(entry)`, `sceMcGetDir(entry, 0x10 entries)`, `sceMcRename(file -> new)`,
  `sceMcChdir("/")`, `sceMcRename(dir -> new)`. Type 0's new name is `sprintf(buf, dkcl_fmt, number)`; the number argument is
  confirmed in the native match.
- String literals at_1016..at_1031 are the screen's English text, at_1159..at_1169 the search
  masks, suffixes, "/" and debug printf formats.

## Verification
- `scripts/re/draft.sh --header ps2/include/convviewlp.hpp`: compiles.
- `ps2/src/convviewlp.cpp` with `#include "convviewlp.hpp"` compiles (6 NO DRAFT, as expected).

## Draft coverage
All six game functions have named, typed C++ bodies. The source uses `MC_DIR_ENTRY` (a 0x40-byte directory entry with the name at +0x20) and `SAVE_CONVERT_WORK` (the save image at +0x80 of the conversion allocation). `sceMcEnd` and `sceMcRename` are declared in the SDK memory-card header.

The conversion loop preserves the four-phase progression, a maximum of 64 directory entries from each search, the North American to PAL directory rename, and the duplicate search for numbered game saves and the two special saves. The retail allocation holds 32 source directory records while the copy loop accepts up to 64; the draft keeps this bound exactly. `InitSaveFileInfoTablePtr` resets the counters and only the first 32 records of the size table, as the retail stores show.

## Native coverage

All game functions in this unit are active native C++, including the conversion
loop. Earlier guarded drafts have been superseded by the canonical whole-unit
match. The generated static initializer also matches; constructor registration
is supplied only by the native globals.

## Native static initialization

Native `DataBuffer__3` and `Stack_ReadBuff__3` globals emit the retail initializer calls in order. The generated 44-byte initializer matches exactly.

## SaveDataConvertLoop native match

The active native loop reproduces all 0x7E0 function bytes and all resolved
relocations. Both directory arrays require 64-byte alignment; the inner array
has 32 entries even though each read requests only 16. With these declarations,
MWCC reproduces the 0x3CE0 stack frame and all buffer offsets observed through
`decompile.sh`: directory buffers at 0xA0 and 0x10A0, path at 0x18C0, then the
three 128-byte format/name arrays. Existing save numbers use the `listed`
index, which advances independently from the directory scan counter. Strings
are inline literals and the local name arrays are ordinary C++ initializers.

Retail's declared function size is 0x7E0, ending after the return delay slot at
0x325C60. The following 0x20 zero bytes precede `Vu_prog_3dsp` at 0x325C80 and
are supplied by the generated linker script's alignment. The checker verifies
that the native function ends exactly at the script's `contents_end` and the
omitted retail tail is entirely zero. Objdiff's target function size now uses
the declared retail extent, rather than absorbing that linker padding.
