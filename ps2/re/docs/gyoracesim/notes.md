# gyoracesim notes

Fish race simulation. `sgInitGyoRace` (gyorace) fills `RaceInfo` (0x1F59490, a `grRACE_INFO`),
calls `grGyoRaceSimulate` once (result stored in `time_max`), then the race is replayed with
`grGetFishProgress(&RaceInfo, fish, race_cnt, &prog)`. No class in `class_units.tsv` is owned by
this unit; all types are plain structs. `gyorace.hpp` forward-declares `grRACE_INFO` /
`grRACE_PROGRESS`; `gyorace.cpp` includes `gyoracesim.hpp` to use their fields.

## Linkage
- Global: `grGyoRaceSimulate`, `grGetFishProgress`, `rand_prob` (in header).
- Local (static, belong in the .cpp): FishDist, StepFish, LaneBattleStep, CollisionFish,
  StepGyoRace, GetRaceDivision, GetRaceDivisionLength, GetCourseR, FishModifyParam,
  CharacterBonus, RndFishParam, GetPaseRatio, SetRaceFishParam, GetFishData, irn55, init_rnd,
  irnd, rnd, nrnd, GetRandomNumber.
- All data is local: `fish_data` (.rodata 0x3630C0, `grFISH_DATA[18]`, 0x1F8), `jrand` (.sbss,
  int, index into `ia`, starts at 0x37 after init), `ia` (.bss, `int ia[56]`, 0xE0; Knuth
  subtractive generator, modulus 1000000000, 1-based, `ia[55]` = seed). So no externs in header.
- `at_483__2` (.sdata, 8 bytes) = `{-1, -1}` initialiser of a local `int[2]` in LaneBattleStep
  (best neighbour per side). `at_1059__3` (.rodata 0x18) = jump table of the 6-case `tactics`
  switch in FishModifyParam.

## Signatures / return types
- `grGyoRaceSimulate` returns StepGyoRace's int (v0 untouched before `jr`; stored as time_max).
- `grGetFishProgress` int 0/1. `StepFish(int step, RACE_FISH_PARAM*)` int: 1 when finished or
  no record. `StepGyoRace` int = last step index + after-goal steps. `GetRaceDivision(float)` int
  0..4, -1 at/after 16. `GetRaceDivisionLength(int)` float: <0 -> 0, 0/4 -> 2, else 4 (course
  divisions 0-2, 2-6, 6-10, 10-14, 14-16). `GetCourseR(float pos, float lane)` float, always 1.0
  (computes `(int)` something & 7 but every branch gives 1.0). `FishDist` float =
  (a.pos+a.velocity) - (b.pos+b.velocity). `GetFishData(int fish_no)` grFISH_DATA* or null.
  `GetPaseRatio(int tactics, float out[5])` sets all to 1/5. `rnd()` float = irnd()/1e9;
  `nrnd()` = sum of 12 rnd() - 6; `GetRandomNumber(float mean, float range)` = mean +
  nrnd()*(range/3); `rand_prob(int pct)` = ((irnd()>>12) % 100) < pct.

## grRACE_INFO (0x1DC; RaceInfo symbol size 0x1DC, memset 0x1DC in sgInitGyoRace)
- 0x000 seed u32: 0 -> seed is a CRandom-LCG (x*0x5D588B65+1, start 0x3526D02F) hash of each
  entrant's name chars and the ten ints 0x18..0x3C; sgInitGyoRace writes 0.
- 0x004 unk_4: never seen.
- 0x008 fish_num: loop bound everywhere; sgInit writes 6.
- 0x00C grFISH_PARAM fish[6]: stride 0x40 (strlen at +0xC, ints +0x24..+0x48 per entrant;
  SetRaceFishParam copies 0x40 bytes as 8 dword pairs = struct copy).
- 0x18C step_max: sgInit writes 1000; progress buffers are `new[] 24000` = 1000*0x18.
- 0x190 grRACE_PROGRESS* progress[6]: memset `step_max*0x18` in SetRaceFishParam.
- 0x1A8 after_goal_step: sgInit writes 0x14; StepGyoRace performs up to 21 further steps after all fish reach the goal: the extra-step
  counter runs from 0 through after_goal_step, inclusive, and is limited by step_max.
- 0x1AC int rank[6]: StepGyoRace, 1 + number of fish with smaller goal_time.
- 0x1C4 float goal_time[6]: step - (pos-16)/velocity when StepFish first returns 1. gyorace
  reads `RaceInfo+0x1C4+rank*4`.

## grFISH_PARAM (0x40) — sources from sgInitGyoRace (game_data entry = CGameDataUsed, fish at +0x10 = BREEDFISH_USED)
- 0x00 name[0x18]: strcpy of fish name.
- 0x18 fish_no: CGameDataUsed.item_no (s16 +2); key of GetFishData.
- 0x1C affinity: BREEDFISH_USED.unk_3a (byte); equal to grFISH_DATA.affinity -> all x1.1.
  Name is mine; real meaning unknown.
- 0x20 bonus_type: BREEDFISH_USED.unk_16 (byte); CharacterBonus switch (0..3), see enum.
- 0x24 power: param[4] -> FishModifyParam out[4] -> RACE_FISH_PARAM.power (battle strength diff).
- 0x28 stamina: param[3], reduced by (n-1)*10% where n = BREEDFISH fatigue counter (+1 per race
  for the player's fish). Becomes out[0], shared out by GetPaseRatio over divisions into accel[].
  "stamina" is an inferred name.
- 0x2C/0x30/0x34 speed[3]: param[0..2] -> out[1..3] -> speed[0], speed[2], speed[4]; speed[1] =
  (s0 + s1/2)/1.5, speed[3] = (s2 + s1/2)/1.5. The four ints 0x28..0x34 of all entrants are
  averaged (sum / (n*4)) as the nrnd scale in FishModifyParam.
- 0x38 tactics: GetGyoRaceAquariumNo() for the player's fish / random 0..5 / GetOmakeGyoracerTactics;
  FishModifyParam switch 0..5 adjusts out[1..3] and out[5] (aggression). No enum (meanings only
  numeric tweaks): 0 aggr-0.5, x N(1,0.1); 1 x N(1,0.2); 2 aggr-0.3, s0 x N(1.5,.2), s1 x.873,
  s2 x.5; 3 aggr+0.2, s0,s1 x.8, s2 x N(1.8,.4); 4 aggr+0.5, x N(1,.2); 5 aggr+0.1, s1 x N(1.3,.3).
- 0x3C lane: written by sgInit (0..5 rotation).

## grRACE_PROGRESS (0x18; stride 0x18, old_prog 0x90 = 6 entries)
0 pos f, 4 lane int (sgInit: `lane*15+190`), 8 lane_pos f (StepFish writes (float)lane;
interpolated by grGetFishProgress with pos), 0xC state u8 (0 => grGetFishProgress returns 0;
Jikkyou tests ==2 for push commentary), 0xD battle u8, 0xE pad, 0x10 battle_target int,
0x14 battle_hits int (copied from RACE_FISH_PARAM 0x60/0x64).

## RACE_FISH_PARAM (0xA0; memset 0xA0, stride 0xA0, grGyoRaceSimulate local array 0x3C0 = 6)
- 0x00 speed[5]: StepFish target = speed[div]*0.0002 + 0.1, times rank_ratio[rank-1] if rank 1..6.
- 0x14 accel[5]: out[0]*ratio[i]/(len_i*10); RndFishParam scales speed[]/accel[] by N(1,0.5), clamp 0.
- 0x28..0x4F: never accessed (only memset).
- 0x50 velocity: v += (accel - (v-target)/0.016 + boost*1.25)*0.0016, min 0.01; past the goal
  v -= 0.01. Initial N(0.02,0.02) clamped 0.
- 0x54 pos: += v*GetCourseR(); goal at >= 16.0 (state set 3 in the record).
- 0x58 lane: int 0..5 (CollisionFish buckets by it into 6 lanes).
- 0x5C state s8 (1 init, 2 push, back to 1), 0x5D battle s8 (1 during push).
- 0x60 battle_target, 0x64 battle_hits (incremented on rand_prob win), 0x68 power (out[4]),
  0x6C aggression (out[5]), 0x70 battle_urge (+= aggression*crowd, >1 starts push),
  0x74 battle_time (set 5.0, -1 per step), 0x78 boost (clamped +-1, decays 0.05/step; push winner
  +0.5, loser -0.25), 0x7C rank (1 + number of fish ahead, StepGyoRace).
- 0x80 rank_ratio[6]: CharacterBonus, linear from first to last place; [0] forced 1.0.
- 0x98 progress_num (= step_max), 0x9C progress (= info->progress[i]).

## grFISH_DATA (0x1C; fish_data 0x1F8 / 18 rows; GetFishData stride 0x1C, loop 0x12)
int fish_no (0x136, 0x140..0x150), float power% (+4 -> 0x24), stamina% (+8 -> 0x28),
speed%[3] (+0xC..0x14 -> 0x2C..0x34), int affinity (+0x18). Type name is not retail (none known).

## Enums
- grRACE_STATE (0..3) from StepFish (3 at goal), SetRaceFishParam (1), LaneBattleStep (2/1),
  grGetFishProgress (0 = no record). Names mine.
- grCHARA_BONUS_TYPE from CharacterBonus: 0 first=1+|x|, last=1-|x|; 1 first=1-0.2|x|,
  last=1+|x|; 2 both 1; 3 both N(1,0.01); x = N(0,0.01). Names mine.

## First game
No equivalent in Dark Cloud 1 (no fish race).

## C++ draft status

The default build has 17 perfect functions and six assembly functions; it verifies byte
identical to retail. The draft check reports 17 matches and six differences across 23 functions.
All 20 retail-local helpers have internal linkage. The 18-row fish data table and the random
number state are defined with native types in this unit.

grGetFishProgress retains a typed member-copy draft and an assembly fallback. Native assignment,
member copies and memcpy do not reproduce retail's copy instructions. LaneBattleStep,
CollisionFish, StepGyoRace, FishModifyParam and CharacterBonus retain the upstream guarded
drafts. StepGyoRace's restored upstream draft differs from retail, although the previous guarded
draft matched; the default implementation remains assembly.
