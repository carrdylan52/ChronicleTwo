# editmenu data migration (October 8, 2026)

Baseline: `63f7a9e5`, 153 `INCLUDE_RODATA`, 101 `INCLUDE_BSS`,
68/6,092 matched initialized data bytes. All 61 functions already match.
Public header declarations and layouts remain source-compatible.

## Named uninitialized state

The named menu-state reservations are typed C++ definitions. Types follow
the existing declarations and documented layouts, with array sizes corrected
against retail symbols and their actual accesses. `HouseChildPartInfo` has
22 pointers (house/resident plus up to twenty children), `DownLoadMes` has six
pointers, `GeoBoardListTitlePutOffset` has five pairs, and
`GeoramaMesMakeLine` has five shorts. Padding belongs to section pieces, not
to those arrays. `GeoramaPenkiNum` retains its declared 16-short object;
only the first eight entries are consumed as paint quantities here.

Most definitions have internal linkage. `HouseChildPartInfo` and
`PartsMakeOkTable` retain external linkage because the generated whole-unit
`ps2/asm/pal/data/main/vutext.data.s` contains cross-unit relocations naming
them. Making either static fails the link with `Symbol not found`; these
references belong to an unowned generated unit, so this lane preserves them
without editing generated data or linker tooling. Their object sizes are
still the exact retail 0x58 and 0x400 bytes.

The cached blank names and initialization flags retain their existing
once-only setup in the matched functions. `cnt_2177` counts the eighty-frame
placed-house arrow-blink cycle; it is not a resident count. No runtime
initialization function or codegen helper is introduced.

| `DestroyMaxNum_3584` | `short DestroyMaxNum_3584`: Maximum quantity of the selected Georama part that can be removed. |
| `init_3585` | `signed char init_3585`: Whether the cached removal quantity limit has been initialized. |

Named-state checkpoint: 153 `INCLUDE_RODATA`, 16 `INCLUDE_BSS`, and
68/6,092 matched_data after the prescribed refresh. The other 85 BSS markers
are removed. `.private/dataB/receipts/editmenu-named-bss-build.log` records
PAL OK; `editmenu-named-bss-objects.log` records 149/149; the associated
changed-object receipt contains only this lane's two owned units. The other
147 object file hashes equal the warm-built baseline. The header remains
unchanged in this checkpoint. All 61 functions remain exact.

## Model vectors and paint palette

`old_menuparts_pos`, `old_menuparts_rot`, `now_menu_pos_mapparts` and
`georama_adjust_position` are four-float initialized vectors. They retain
zero components in initialized data, rather than BSS. `GeoramaColorList`
contains eight RGB paint colours followed by the negative unpainted sentinel.
The 93-entry `georama_parts_adjust_scaletable` and
`georama_parts_adjust_z_table` arrays supply per-definition model preview
scales and depth offsets. Their decimal float literals round-trip to the
retail binary32 values, including non-integral scale constants.

Each vector/table was migrated and checked separately. Receipts are under
`.private/dataB/receipts/editmenu-{original-position,original-rotation,
current-part-position,preview-offset,paint-colours,preview-scales,
preview-depths}-*`. Every check reports PAL OK and 149/149 objects, with
only the two owned unit hashes differing from baseline. This checkpoint
removes seven initialized-data markers (146 remain).

## Board and list tables

The paint item identifiers, view-to-list indices, active/inactive board and
scrollbar texture rectangles, language-specific analysis/house title offsets,
resident labels, message-column positions and analysis topic-button origins
now have typed initialized definitions. The existing drawing APIs consume
flat short rectangle tables, so these retain their declared flat interface;
two-dimensional tables retain rows with their actual dimensions.
`offset_2176` contains seven language entries, not the eight entries in its
former extern. `postbl_2175` has eight texture rectangles, including the
extra retail row. `tbl_957` retains -1 for views without a part list.

Each table was migrated separately and passed PAL and all object checks.
Receipts: `editmenu-paint-items-*`, `editmenu-list-indexes-*`,
`editmenu-active-board-*`, and `editmenu-table-<symbol>-*` beneath
`.private/dataB/receipts/`. All other 147 object hashes remain identical.
This group removes fourteen more markers (132 initialized markers remain).

## Inline strings: initialization and drawing

Form/table names, debug scripts, menu textures, the download blank name,
and placed-house/message blank names are inline literals at their use sites.
Shared literal markers disappear only after their last extern reference is
replaced. Every byte above ASCII is encoded as a three-digit octal escape,
so Shift-JIS strings are preserved independently of the editor encoding.

The ten function-sized steps from SetEditMenuEnv through
MenuGeoramaMessageMake each pass the full PAL and 149-unit checks. Receipts
are `editmenu-literals-<function>-*` in `.private/dataB/receipts/`.
This checkpoint has 118 initialized markers and 16 BSS markers.

## Inline strings: Georama class methods

The eight function-sized steps from InitEnd through CalcTex replace native
pack member names, Georama form and part names, cursor actions, build-dialog
scripts and formatted colour-cell names with inline strings. File traversal
still uses GetPackFile's typed serialized-buffer API. Literal contents,
including the Japanese house-information form name, are byte-identical.

Each step passes PAL and all 149 objects, with the other 147 object hashes
unchanged. Receipts are `editmenu-literals-CMenuGeorama-<method>-*` and
`editmenu-literals-MakeMsgPartsItemInfo-*`. Remaining initialized markers: 86.

## Inline strings: Georama input handlers

Base navigation, part placement/removal, part construction, placed-house
inspection, paint selection and input dispatch now use their inline script
actions and diagnostic messages. The six independent function steps from
MenuGeoramaBasePush through MenuGeoramaPushKey retain zero object differences.
The exact Japanese diagnostic bytes remain octal escaped.

Receipts: `editmenu-literals-MenuGeorama<handler>-*`; PAL and all 149 object
checks pass, and the other 147 object hashes remain unchanged. Remaining
initialized markers: 59.

## Inline strings: villager removal

KeyStep's villager-removal form/part names, script actions, pack members,
formatted colour cells and cursor/list templates are inline strings. The
removal initializer's background and form filenames are also inline.
`editmenu-literals-CRemovalMenu-KeyStep-*` and
`editmenu-literals-MenuRemovalInit-*` record PAL OK and 149/149 objects,
with all other 147 hashes unchanged. No string extern remains. The two
file-list string markers remain until their owning pointer tables migrate.
Twenty-two initialized markers remain at this checkpoint.

## Natural local aggregates

MenuGeoramaMakePush initializes an aligned `sceVu0FVECTOR` at the river
query with `{0,0,0,-1}`. Its compiler-created initialized template replaces
`at_3757`; the former float/quadword overlay type is unnecessary. Both
IsMakeObject item-name arrays use `{make_parts->edit_name}` directly instead
of loading a float through a cast into pointer storage. Their generated zero
templates still need the two anonymous BSS markers until tooling can name
them. DrawDownLoadAnaunce uses the existing `RGBAQ_TYPE` aggregate directly
for its two window colours, removing the redundant colour overlay union.
The redundant MakeBoardDrawInfo extern is removed; menudraw.hpp owns its
existing declaration.

The three function changes each pass complete object and PAL checks. The
combined cleanup passes 149/149, with all other 147 hashes unchanged:
`editmenu-{river-vector,item-arrays,window-colours,natural-aggregates}-*`.
Twenty-one initialized markers and sixteen BSS markers remain here.

## Initialized state, file lists and input dispatch

The scrolling line count, analysis percentage, request reconstruction flag,
view-to-action map and initial list message offsets are native typed data.
The existing view enum expresses the one-based action numbers. The new
source-local GeoramaMessageList enum records that slot 3 is the placed-part
list and slot 4 is the house list; GeoramaInitialMessage names the initial
system message IDs, while the compact signed-byte table retains their
base-relative offsets. Every public declaration remains unchanged.

DestroyNum_3583 and DestroyPartsName_3587 are explicit zero/null defaults in
retail initialized small data. An ordinary scalar `= 0` emits .sbss and
postprocessing correctly rejects converting it to .sdata. The pinned
compiler's `explicit_zero_data` pragma is supported (its pragma inventory
contains the name). Scoped `on`/`reset` pairs around only these declarations
preserve native initialized .sdata and match without runtime initialization.
The initialized zero vector arrays already emit file-backed data naturally.

The two two-pointer file lists contain an inline pack name and null. The
nine-entry MenuGeoramaPushFunc table names the existing native handlers,
retaining its three null action slots. All data is writable where the
existing pointer-consuming APIs require mutable types.

Each individual migration passes PAL and the complete 149-unit check.
Receipts: `editmenu-{download-scroll-lines,analysis-percentage,
request-rebuild-flag,view-actions,list-window-messages,
explicit-zero-quantity,explicit-zero-removal-name,georama-file-list,
removal-file-list,input-dispatch,list-message-enums}-*` beneath
`.private/dataB/receipts/`. All other 147 object hashes remain identical.
The failed ordinary zero definition is recorded separately as
`editmenu-removal-quantity-build.log` and is not retained.
Nine compiler-generated initialized markers remain at this checkpoint.

## Native aggregate templates, switch table and vtables

The existing C++ local aggregates supply the child-number list (21 ints),
cursor list counts (11 ints), model position (four floats), window colour
(eight-byte RGBAQ), scrollbar size (two ints) and scrollbar line counts
(two ints). Their six initialized template markers are removed individually;
no separately named constant or dummy local replaces them. CalcCursorPosition's
existing switch supplies its jump table naturally. Both class vtables come
from the existing C++ class definitions and overrides; their markers are
removed without writing a vtable or special member.

Each of the nine marker removals passes PAL and all 149 object checks:
`editmenu-native-<retail symbol>-*` beneath `.private/dataB/receipts/`.
Initialized marker count is now zero. Sixteen anonymous BSS markers remain;
every one has a natural local aggregate initializer, including the newly
cleaned item-name arrays. The tooling limitation is documented below.

## Final source organization and exact cleanup

All 119 named/native global definitions are documented and ordered by retail
address, including the existing MenuGeoramaStack and two marker rectangles.
The constructor-bearing globals retain their relative order; the compiler
still emits the exact static initializer. The input handler table has ordinary
forward declarations for its existing functions and named argument purposes.

MenuGeoramaPlacePush indexes `stock_list[j].name` directly instead of adding
a manually maintained byte offset to the first row's name. MenuGeoramaMakePush
uses a numeric short conversion of max_num instead of a short-pointer view
of its integer storage. Both function cleanups pass independently and retain
zero byte and relocation differences. Receipts:
`editmenu-{quantity-conversion,stock-index,native-data-order,
final-natural-cleanup}-*`. PAL is OK, all 149 objects pass and all other
147 object file hashes remain identical.

## Remaining source cleanup limits

Native definitions of now_menu_pos_mapparts and georama_adjust_position are
exact float[4] objects. Replacing their inherited quadword-view copy with a
16-byte typed GeoramaVector and compiler-generated assignment preserves the
data and object extent but changes source/destination address scheduling in
LoadGeoramaPart. The checker records six problems (one byte-difference report
and five relocation-context differences). Ordinary memcpy adds a real call,
changes later instruction positions and reports 24 problems. Neither source
alternative is retained. Existing mglib notes separately rule out repeating
inline_intrinsics/level-4 memcpy probes and record crashes for direct __memcpy.
The inherited copy remains a source-style limitation; no new overlay type,
copy special member, dummy local, assembly or helper is introduced.

Replacing the three inherited form/house pointer-induction loops with direct
array indexing also changes emitted instructions in MenuGeoramaInit,
InitEnd and MenuGeoramaListDraw. Those alternatives are restored rather than
changing compiler state or retaining a nonzero object diff. Their receipts
are `editmenu-{init-form-index,end-form-index,house-row-index}-build.log` and
the corresponding `-failed-objects.log`; private source snapshots retain the
exact attempted forms. Every accepted function remains at zero differences.

## Remaining assembly and independent native-data proof

Sixteen anonymous BSS markers remain because existing tooling cannot name
natural zero initializer templates after marker removal. Their types, sizes,
owners, reference offsets and the unapplied proposal are documented in
[anonymous-data-20261008.md](anonymous-data-20261008.md). Removing them without
that shared-tool change cannot pass the current complete-object check.

The private compiler-only editmenu object passes a complete check after the
proposed naming pass: 0xC7E8 allocated bytes and 2,581 relocations, with no
assembly data placeholders/transplants. Production postprocess_object.py is
unchanged; the proposed pass is tested only against a private object copy.
Receipt: `.private/dataB/receipts/editmenu-proposed-native-only-object.log`.
This proves the natural aggregates already supply all held BSS templates;
it does not treat the proposal as integrated or remove the production markers.

The prescribed unmodified report still records 68/6,092 matched initialized
bytes at the native-data checkpoint. As with menucommon, its source-only base
bypasses postprocessing, literal naming, ordering and piece padding. Marker
counts and canonical complete-object checks establish migration progress;
this lane does not modify coverage tooling or substitute a private metric.
Final standard refresh and final validation receipts are recorded below.

## Final measured result and commit ledger

The final prescribed refresh records menucommon at 0 initialized/0 BSS
markers and 8/3,816 matched_data (baseline 186/22 and 0/3,816).
editmenu is at 0 initialized/16 BSS markers and 68/6,092 matched_data
(baseline 153/101 and 68/6,092). All 129 and 61 functions remain exact; no
function guard was promoted. The standard coverage totals remain 6,749
matched, 113 guarded, 10 assembly-only and zero fuzzy functions.

Final linked-object validation: PAL OK, 149/149 objects, and the other 147
object file hashes equal the warm baseline. Relevant receipts:

- `.private/dataB/receipts/editmenu-final-natural-cleanup-build.log`
- `.private/dataB/receipts/editmenu-final-natural-cleanup-objects.log`
- `.private/dataB/receipts/editmenu-final-natural-cleanup-changed-objects.json`
- `.private/dataB/receipts/dataB-final-progress.log`
- `.private/dataB/receipts/dataB-final-coverage.log`
- `.private/dataB/final-metrics.json`
- `.private/dataB/receipts/editmenu-final-proposed-native-object.log`

The final private source-only editmenu proof still passes 0xC7E8 bytes and
2,581 relocations after declaration ordering and accepted cleanup. The
menucommon source-only proof uses existing production tooling and passes
0x5558 bytes and 1,021 relocations. Standard metrics are not replaced with
these independent checks. Neither proposal nor generated/private files are
staged. All source/data commits below use carrdylan52's configured identity
and have no attribution trailers.

## Native data marker completion (round 1)

All sixteen remaining BSS reservations are supplied by the existing natural
local aggregate initializers listed in `anonymous-data-20261008.md`. The
shared matcher identifies each exact declared object through every live
opcode-matched retail consumer; compiler counter values supply no identity.
The existing arrays, rectangles, colours and pointer lists are unchanged.
The anonymous-only private proposal is redundant with the round-0 support;
round 1 strengthens all-consumer rejection and preserves native symbol order.

All initialized-data and BSS markers are now absent. Refreshed objdiff
`matched_data` changes from 3,450 to 6,086/6,086 bytes. All existing
native functions and code bytes remain matched; no function is promoted.

Validation receipts in `.private/dtool-r1/`: `final-build.log`,
`final-objects.log`, `final-hashes.json`, `final-refresh.log`,
`resume-metrics.json`, `final-tests.log` and `all-test-scripts.log`. The PAL
verifier and all 149 canonical object comparisons pass. All 142 unowned
object file hashes match the warm baseline. The retained-fallback audit
finds no assembly-supplied piece credited as native data.
