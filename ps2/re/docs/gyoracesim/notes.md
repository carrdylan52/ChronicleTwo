# gyoracesim notes

Fish race simulation. `sgInitGyoRace` (gyorace) fills `RaceInfo` (0x1F59490, a `grRACE_INFO`),
calls `grGyoRaceSimulate` once (result stored in `time_max`), then the race is replayed with
`grGetFishProgress(&RaceInfo, fish, race_cnt, &prog)`. No class in `class_units.tsv` is owned by
this unit; all types are plain structs. `gyorace.hpp` only forward-declares `grRACE_INFO` /
`grRACE_PROGRESS`; it will need `#include "gyoracesim.hpp"` once gyorace's bodies use the fields.

## Linkage
- Global: `grGyoRaceSimulate`, `grGetFishProgress`, `rand_prob` (in header).
- Local (static, belong in the .cpp): FishDist, StepFish, LaneBattleStep, CollisionFish,
  StepGyoRace, GetRaceDivision, GetRaceDivisionLength, GetCourseR, FishModifyParam,
  CharacterBonus, RndFishParam, GetPaseRatio, SetRaceFishParam, GetFishData, irn55, init_rnd,
  irnd, rnd, nrnd, GetRandomNumber.
- All data is local: `fish_data` (.rodata 0x3630C0, `grFISH_DATA[18]`, 0x1F8), `jrand` (.sbss,
  int, index into `ia`, starts at 0x37 after init), `ia` (.bss, `int ia[56]`, 0xE0; Knuth
  subtractive generator, modulus 1000000000, 1-based, `ia[55]` = seed). So no externs in header.
- `at_483__2` (.sdata, 8 bytes) = `{-1, -1}` initialiser of a local `int[2]` in LaneBattleStep
  (best neighbour per side). `at_1059__3` (.rodata 0x18) = jump table of the 6-case `tactics`
  switch in FishModifyParam.

## Signatures / return types
- `grGyoRaceSimulate` returns StepGyoRace's int (v0 untouched before `jr`; stored as time_max).
- `grGetFishProgress` int 0/1. `StepFish(int step, RACE_FISH_PARAM*)` int: 1 when finished or
  no record. `StepGyoRace` int = last step index + after-goal steps. `GetRaceDivision(float)` int
  0..4, -1 at/after 16. `GetRaceDivisionLength(int)` float: <0 -> 0, 0/4 -> 2, else 4 (course
  divisions 0-2, 2-6, 6-10, 10-14, 14-16). `GetCourseR(float pos, float lane)` float, always 1.0
  (computes `(int)` something & 7 but every branch gives 1.0). `FishDist` float =
  (a.pos+a.velocity) - (b.pos+b.velocity). `GetFishData(int fish_no)` grFISH_DATA* or null.
  `GetPaseRatio(int tactics, float out[5])` sets all to 1/5. `rnd()` float = irnd()/1e9;
  `nrnd()` = sum of 12 rnd() - 6; `GetRandomNumber(float mean, float range)` = mean +
  nrnd()*(range/3); `rand_prob(int pct)` = ((irnd()>>12) % 100) < pct.

## grRACE_INFO (0x1DC; RaceInfo symbol size 0x1DC, memset 0x1DC in sgInitGyoRace)
- 0x000 seed u32: 0 -> seed is a CRandom-LCG (x*0x5D588B65+1, start 0x3526D02F) hash of each
  entrant's name chars and the ten ints 0x18..0x3C; sgInitGyoRace writes 0.
- 0x004 unk_4: never seen.
- 0x008 fish_num: loop bound everywhere; sgInit writes 6.
- 0x00C grFISH_PARAM fish[6]: stride 0x40 (strlen at +0xC, ints +0x24..+0x48 per entrant;
  SetRaceFishParam copies 0x40 bytes as 8 dword pairs = struct copy).
- 0x18C step_max: sgInit writes 1000; progress buffers are `new[] 24000` = 1000*0x18.
- 0x190 grRACE_PROGRESS* progress[6]: memset `step_max*0x18` in SetRaceFishParam.
- 0x1A8 after_goal_step: sgInit writes 0x14; StepGyoRace steps that many more after all goal.
- 0x1AC int rank[6]: StepGyoRace, 1 + number of fish with smaller goal_time.
- 0x1C4 float goal_time[6]: step - (pos-16)/velocity when StepFish first returns 1. gyorace
  reads `RaceInfo+0x1C4+rank*4`.

## grFISH_PARAM (0x40) — sources from sgInitGyoRace (game_data entry = CGameDataUsed, fish at +0x10 = BREEDFISH_USED)
- 0x00 name[0x18]: strcpy of fish name.
- 0x18 fish_no: CGameDataUsed.item_no (s16 +2); key of GetFishData.
- 0x1C affinity: BREEDFISH_USED.unk_3a (byte); equal to grFISH_DATA.affinity -> all x1.1.
  Name is mine; real meaning unknown.
- 0x20 bonus_type: BREEDFISH_USED.unk_16 (byte); CharacterBonus switch (0..3), see enum.
- 0x24 power: param[4] -> FishModifyParam out[4] -> RACE_FISH_PARAM.power (battle strength diff).
- 0x28 stamina: param[3], reduced by (n-1)*10% where n = BREEDFISH fatigue counter (+1 per race
  for the player's fish). Becomes out[0], shared out by GetPaseRatio over divisions into accel[].
  "stamina" is an inferred name.
- 0x2C/0x30/0x34 speed[3]: param[0..2] -> out[1..3] -> speed[0], speed[2], speed[4]; speed[1] =
  (s0 + s1/2)/1.5, speed[3] = (s2 + s1/2)/1.5. The four ints 0x28..0x34 of all entrants are
  averaged (sum / (n*4)) as the nrnd scale in FishModifyParam.
- 0x38 tactics: GetGyoRaceAquariumNo() for the player's fish / random 0..5 / GetOmakeGyoracerTactics;
  FishModifyParam switch 0..5 adjusts out[1..3] and out[5] (aggression). No enum (meanings only
  numeric tweaks): 0 aggr-0.5, x N(1,0.1); 1 x N(1,0.2); 2 aggr-0.3, s0 x N(1.5,.2), s1 x.873,
  s2 x.5; 3 aggr+0.2, s0,s1 x.8, s2 x N(1.8,.4); 4 aggr+0.5, x N(1,.2); 5 aggr+0.1, s1 x N(1.3,.3).
- 0x3C lane: written by sgInit (0..5 rotation).

## grRACE_PROGRESS (0x18; stride 0x18, old_prog 0x90 = 6 entries)
0 pos f, 4 lane int (sgInit: `lane*15+190`), 8 lane_pos f (StepFish writes (float)lane;
interpolated by grGetFishProgress with pos), 0xC state u8 (0 => grGetFishProgress returns 0;
Jikkyou tests ==2 for push commentary), 0xD battle u8, 0xE pad, 0x10 battle_target int,
0x14 battle_hits int (copied from RACE_FISH_PARAM 0x60/0x64).

## RACE_FISH_PARAM (0xA0; memset 0xA0, stride 0xA0, grGyoRaceSimulate local array 0x3C0 = 6)
- 0x00 speed[5]: StepFish target = speed[div]*0.0002 + 0.1, times rank_ratio[rank-1] if rank 1..6.
- 0x14 accel[5]: out[0]*ratio[i]/(len_i*10); RndFishParam scales speed[]/accel[] by N(1,0.5), clamp 0.
- 0x28..0x4F: never accessed (only memset).
- 0x50 velocity: v += (accel - (v-target)/0.016 + boost*1.25)*0.0016, min 0.01; past the goal
  v -= 0.01. Initial N(0.02,0.02) clamped 0.
- 0x54 pos: += v*GetCourseR(); goal at >= 16.0 (state set 3 in the record).
- 0x58 lane: int 0..5 (CollisionFish buckets by it into 6 lanes).
- 0x5C state u8 (1 init, 2 push, back to 1), 0x5D battle u8 (1 during push).
- 0x60 battle_target, 0x64 battle_hits (incremented on rand_prob win), 0x68 power (out[4]),
  0x6C aggression (out[5]), 0x70 battle_urge (+= aggression*crowd, >1 starts push),
  0x74 battle_time (set 5.0, -1 per step), 0x78 boost (clamped +-1, decays 0.05/step; push winner
  +0.5, loser -0.25), 0x7C rank (1 + number of fish ahead, StepGyoRace).
- 0x80 rank_ratio[6]: CharacterBonus, linear from first to last place; [0] forced 1.0.
- 0x98 progress_num (= step_max), 0x9C progress (= info->progress[i]).

## grFISH_DATA (0x1C; fish_data 0x1F8 / 18 rows; GetFishData stride 0x1C, loop 0x12)
int fish_no (0x136, 0x140..0x150), float power% (+4 -> 0x24), stamina% (+8 -> 0x28),
speed%[3] (+0xC..0x14 -> 0x2C..0x34), int affinity (+0x18). Type name is not retail (none known).

## Enums
- grRACE_STATE (0..3) from StepFish (3 at goal), SetRaceFishParam (1), LaneBattleStep (2/1),
  grGetFishProgress (0 = no record). Names mine.
- grCHARA_BONUS_TYPE from CharacterBonus: 0 first=1+|x|, last=1-|x|; 1 first=1-0.2|x|,
  last=1+|x|; 2 both 1; 3 both N(1,0.01); x = N(0,0.01). Names mine.

## First game
No equivalent in Dark Cloud 1 (no fish race).

## C++ draft status
- `GetPaseRatio`, `GetFishData`, and `rnd` compile with byte-identical MWCC output.
- `GetRaceDivisionLength`, `GetCourseR`, `irn55`, `init_rnd`, `irnd`, `nrnd`,
  `GetRandomNumber`, and `rand_prob` have typed C++ drafts under `NONMATCHING`.
  Their first promotion attempts did not match, so the default build keeps their
  retail assembly.
- The generator draft uses the documented 56-element state array. Its first
  promotion attempt reached 95.71% for `init_rnd`, but that is not an exact match.
- Typed `NONMATCHING` drafts now cover all remaining race functions: the seed
  hash and simulation entry, progress interpolation, fish stepping, collision
  ordering, lane battles, division setup, figure modification, character
  bonus, and parameter randomization. `FishModifyParam` needed direct assembly
  analysis because m2c could not resolve its six-way tactics jump table.
- `RndFishParam` matched byte for byte and passed isolated whole-image
  promotion. The remaining new drafts failed their first isolated promotion
  and retain retail assembly in the default build. The full default build
  remained byte-identical after the promotion.

## StepGyoRace draft
`StepGyoRace` records the first completed step of each fish as a fractional goal time, assigns a current rank by position each step, resolves collisions and lane battles, then assigns final ranks by goal time. It records up to `after_goal_step + 1` further steps and returns the next step index. The guarded C++ draft compiles; the assembly fallback remains active.

`FISH_STATS` is the six-float output buffer passed to `FishModifyParam`.
`SetRaceFishParam` maps its fifth and sixth floats directly to the race
entrant's power and aggression fields, so those members use those names.
The promoted function remains exact in objdiff.

## Deterministic floating-point compilation

`CharacterBonus__FP12grFISH_PARAMP15RACE_FISH_PARAMi` at `0x00323E90` needs
binary32 `0.01f` (`0x3C23D70A`) evaluated before `1.0f` in the random-bonus
call. Selecting `0.01f` alone would also reorder the earlier
`GetRandomNumber(0.0f, 0.01f)` calls. The Satan's Fiddle JSON profile therefore
sets `evaluate_first` to true for both `0x3C23D70A` and `0x00000000` in this
function. The earlier calls keep their retail order, while the later call
materializes `0.01f` before `1.0f`. Each selector applies to all matching
constants, without relying on their visitation order.

With MWCC 3.0-011126, `-O3,p`, both mwccgap passes and the normal section
fixup, the complete unit passes the retail checker: `0x3150` initialized bytes and
86 relocations. This remains true with the call-argument consumer hook.
`CollisionFish` differs by eight register choices in its final per-lane separation loop; moving the lane counter declaration did not change the allocation.

## CollisionFish and StepGyoRace caller dependency

A post-merge isolated trial with the explicit GPR 0x30/FPR 0 helper history compiles both guarded drafts natively. StepGyoRace then matches completely: its retail call to LaneBattleStep relies on a0 remaining live across CollisionFish. When CollisionFish remains an opaque assembly fallback, the compiler reloads a0 and shifts the following call by four bytes. The joint trial retains one canonical error in CollisionFish at 0x003231B1, in the final per-lane traversal register assignment. Advancing one fish pointer directly, and using the existing outer traversal index with a separate inner index, both preserve the retail operations but leave that allocation difference. Both fallbacks remain active until the joint unit passes.
