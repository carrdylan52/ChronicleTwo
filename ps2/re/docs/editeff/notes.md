# editeff: reverse-engineering notes

Edit-mode (Georama) effects: star burst on placing a part, paint-drop splash on painting
(and on placing a river), and the hop/sway/squash/remove animations of placed parts.
No first-game counterpart (the first game has no `editeff` unit). The header is `ps2/include/editeff.hpp`.

## Globals (all in `ps2/src/editeff.cpp`)
| Symbol | Addr | Size | Binding | Type / meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `EffectFlag` | 0x37E610 sbss | 4 | LOCAL | `int`; set to 1 by EditPlaceEffect/EditPaintEffect, cleared by EditInitPlaceEffect; gates EditPEffectStep/Draw. |
| `EffectState` | 0x37E614 sbss | 4 | LOCAL | `int`; only written (0) in EditInitPlaceEffect. |
| `PaintEffect` | 0x37E618 sbss | 4 | LOCAL | `CPaintEffect *`; `__construct_new_array(mem, CPaintEffect ctor, 0, 0x400, 1)` in EditSetEffectBuffer (`new CPaintEffect[1]`, 0x410 bytes with array header, Alloc 0x42 qw). |
| `_StarEffect` | 0x1F588C0 bss | 0x300 | LOCAL | `CStarEffect[3]`; constructed in `__sinit_editeff_cpp` by `__construct_array(.., ctor, 0, 0x100, 3)`. |
| `CurPartsBuff` | 0x1F58BC0 bss | 0x30 | LOCAL | `mgCMemory`; `Init()` in sinit (inline ctor), `stSetBuffer(Alloc(0x5DC), ..)` in EditSetEffectBuffer; removal copies of CMapParts are `new (CurPartsBuff)`. |
| `at_1037__6` | 0x1F58BF0 | 0x20 | LOCAL | function-local static in CStarEffect::Draw (two float[4] size rows; [3] and [7] read). Compiler-generated. |
| `at_1112__3` | 0x1F58C10 | 0x10 | LOCAL | function-local static in CPaintEffect::Draw (float[4]; [2],[3] used as size z/w). |
| `PlaceAnime` | 0x1F58C20 bss | 0x1B0 | GLOBAL | `CPlaceAnime[3]` (stride 0x90). Only global datum -> the only `extern` in the header. |

The LOCAL ones must be `static` in the .cpp (cannot be `extern`ed in the header).
`.data` literals: `at_1038__6`/`at_1039__4` (star uv0/uv1 rows, 2 x float[4]), `at_1040__5`
(colour {128,128,128,_}), `at_1106__3`/`at_1107__4` (paint uv0/uv1 rows), `at_821__5` = "haichi_eff"
(texture name, rodata). All function-local initialised arrays copied onto the stack.

All 26 non-member functions are GLOBAL (none in local_symbols.tsv).

## CStarEffect (size 0x100) : CObject (0x70)
Size: `_StarEffect` 0x300 / 3, loop stride 0x100, `__construct_array` 0x100.
Vtable `__vt__11CStarEffect` (0x74, same as CObject): overrides only slot 0x34 `Draw` (returns int,
the result of `mgDrawDirect(mgCVisual*, mat)`). Step/ParamInit are non-virtual (direct jal).
Ctor 0x301550 (emitted after all functions = inline/implicit): stores mgCObject vt, Initialize via vt,
CObject vt, Initialize via vt (CObject ctor inlined here despite map.hpp declaring it out-of-line at 0x1631B0),
own vt, then mgCVisual/mgC3DSprite vt at +0xBC (= sprite at 0xA0, vptr at sprite+0x1C) with Initialize via vt 0x30.
| Off | Field | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0x10/0x20/0x30 | mgCObject position/rotation/scale | Draw: `mgCreateMatrixPY(m, this+0x10, this[0x24])`; Step writes 0x30..0x38 (scale ease to 10), 0x24 yaw, 0x14 pos.y |

| 0x74 | spin_speed f | Step: +=0.008 for frames 11..29; yaw += it |
| 0x78 | rise_speed f | Step: +=0.21; pos.y += it |
| 0x7C | alpha f | ParamInit 1; Step -=0.05 after frame 10; Draw colour w = alpha*128 |
| 0x80 | star_angle f | Step `+= mgAngleLimit(yaw+0.2)`; Draw size z (sprite mode 1 = ROTATE) |
| 0x84 | size f | EditPlaceEffect: `dist/300+1`; Draw size rows = size*25, size*15 |
| 0x88 | frame s32 | Step ++ ; EditPlaceEffect reuses star with greatest frame |
| 0x8C | particle_max s32 | EditSetEffectBuffer = 0x40 |

| 0xF0 | mgCTexture* | EditSetEffectBuffer stores GetTexture("haichi_eff"); Draw CPSetTexture |
0x98, 0x9C, 0xF4..0xFC never touched.

EditStarParticle (0x20, name invented): +0 FVECTOR offset (ParamInit: r*sin, size[1]*rnd, r*cos, 1),
+0x14 s32 shape = i%2 (Draw `lw` 0x14 -> row index of size/uv tables). +0x10,+0x18,+0x1C unused.
Draw: `sceVu0MulVector(out, p->position, this->scale)`, w=1; mode 1, alpha 2 (SetAlpha), ZBuf -1.
ParamInit(area, num): `sceVu0ScaleVector(area, area, 0.12)` (modifies caller's vector).

## CPaintEffect (size 0x400) : CObject
Size: new-array stride 0x400. Vtable same shape, overrides only `Draw` (0x34). Ctor 0x2FFC20 identical
in shape to CStarEffect's. EditPEffectDraw calls PaintEffect->Draw virtually (vt 0x34); stars directly.
| Off | Field | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0x70 | state | ParamInit 1; Step: wait-- and when <1 -> 2, alpha<0 -> 0; Draw skips 0,1,3 |
| 0x74 | shape s32 | EditPaintEffect sets 1 when `river`; Draw uv row index |
| 0x80 | color FVECTOR | copied from param, `ScaleVector(1.2)`, rgb clamped to 255; Draw colour xyz |
| 0x90 | mgCTexture* | GetTexture("haichi_eff") in EditPaintEffect |
| 0xA0 | mgC3DSprite | Draw; mode 0, SetAlpha 1 |
| 0xF0 | alpha f | ParamInit 1; Step -0.05; Draw w = alpha*128 |
| 0xF4 | wait s32 | ParamInit 10; river sets 0 |
| 0x100 | drop[24] FVECTOR | ParamInit zero, y=10, w = scale*(rnd*0.5+0.5); Draw pos, size = w*10 |
| 0x280 | drop_speed[24] FVECTOR | ParamInit x,z = (rnd-0.5)*8, y=2, w=0; Step y-=0.3, `mgAddVector(drop, speed)` |
0x78, 0x7C, 0x94..0x9C, 0xF8, 0xFC unused. ParamInit(scale): 1.0, or 2.0 for river.
Note Step only advances drops once wait<1 (state 1 counts down, then every frame state is reset to 2).

## CPlaceAnime (size 0x90), no base, no vtable, POD (not constructed in sinit)
Stride 0x90 in every loop; PlaceAnime 0x1B0 = 3*0x90.
| Off | Field | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | state | Set 1 by EditSetPlaceAnime; Step sets 0 when done; state funcs test 0/3 |
| 0x04 | type (EditPlaceAnimeType) | param of EditSetPlaceAnime; from `CEditParts+0x324 -> +0x90` (parts data `place_anime`) in EditStartPlaceEffect, or 3 from RemoveMtnStep |

| 0x40/0x50/0x60 | base_rotation/scale/position | Step Get* into them each frame; Step2 Set* from them |
| 0x70 | frame s32 | init 0; type1 ends >60, type2 >15, type3 >10; slot reuse picks greatest frame |
| 0x74 | phase s32 | init 0; type2: 0 hop, ++ on landing |
| 0x78 | power f | init 1.0; type1 *0.92, type2 *0.97 |
| 0x7C | height f | init 0; pos.y = base_pos.y + height; type3 +=20 |
| 0x80 | height_speed f | init 6.0; -=1.2 per frame, height += it, stop at height<0 |
0x0C, 0x84..0x8C unused.
Step type 1: rot.x = power*0.4*sin(frame/30*2pi), rot.z = power*0.4*cos(power*pi/2 + frame/30*2pi).
Type 2 after landing: scale.x = scale.z = power*0.2*sin(..)+1, scale.y = 2 - that. Type 3: scale.x,z -= 0.1 (clamped 0).
Unknown type -> slot freed. Step's type-2 branch has a forward jump to the common tail (write as nested ifs, no goto).
Draw: parts->Draw() only when type == 3 (the copy is not in the map).

EditSetPlaceAnime type 3: picks a free slot, preferring (break) a free slot whose old type is 3, else the
last free one; clears it, resets CurPartsBuff (`lock` 0x1C and `stack_used` 0x24 = 0), `new (CurPartsBuff) CMapParts`
(0x310, inline CMapParts ctor inlined: mgCFrame ctor at +0xC0, CFuncPointMngr vt at +0x2E0 / Initialize at +0x2B0,
+0x2FC = 0), then `src->Copy(*copy, &CurPartsBuff)` (vt 0x80), and animates the copy.
Other types: first free slot, else greatest frame.

## Enums
- EditEffectState: 0 FREE, 1 PLAY, 2 SCATTER (paint only), 3 END. Return values of EditGetPEffectState /
  EditGetPlaceAnimeState (1 if any playing, else 3 if any ended, else 0). *EndCheck: if 3 -> Init*, return 3;
  else return `GetState() != 0`.
- EditPlaceAnimeType: 0 NONE, 1 SWAY, 2 SQUASH, 3 REMOVE (names from observed behaviour).

## Other
- EditPEffectDraw(int): argument unused (EditDraw passes 0xA3).
- EditPlaceEffect: `GetBBox`, half extent via `sceVu0SubVector(max-min)*0.5`, `d = min(mgDistVectorXZ, 300)`,
  num = `(int)(d/5.5555553+10)`, ParamInit({d, h, d}), SetPosition(pos) via vt 0x10, size = d/300+1.
  EditPlaceEffect's CEditParts is passed to CMapParts::GetBBox (CEditParts : CMapParts).
- Return types: int for every state/bool-returning function (`EditPEffectEndCheck` returns 3 or 0/1).

`EditSetPlaceAnime` allocates a `CMapParts` in the temporary parts stack, then initializes its base objects and frame in retail order. A native placement `new CMapParts` was tested but scored 79.74% because that constructor performs different work and scheduling; the explicit sequence remains pending an exact native form.

A typed inline placement overload for `mgCFrame*` and native member placement
construction scores 98.30%: MWCC inserts a second null branch before the
frame constructor and moves a vtable store into the branch delay slot. The
exact manual constructor call remains. Typed array indexing of `_StarEffect`
and `PlaceAnime` changes the increment/address scheduling in three tested
functions (99.11%, 99.62%, and 99.41%), so those byte-offset expressions
remain until an exact typed form is found.

## Native static initialization

Native `_StarEffect[3]` and `CurPartsBuff` globals emit the retail array-construction and memory-initialization calls. The generated 64-byte initializer matches exactly. The existing data/vtable objdiff scores are unchanged from the handwritten initializer.

Further native-constructor trials confirm the remaining obstacle. A placement
`operator new(size_t, mgCFrame&)` overload returning the member address still
makes MWCC emit an extra `beqz` before `__ct__8mgCFrameFv` (98.30%). The
source expressions `target->frame.mgCFrame()` and
`target->frame.mgCFrame::mgCFrame()` compile to a temporary at `sp+0x50`,
not the frame at `target+0xC0`; each scores 99.95% but is semantically wrong.
The exact retail call passes `target+0xC0` in `a0` and uses the `CMapParts`
vtable store as the constructor call's delay slot. Restoring the explicit
constructor alias leaves `EditSetPlaceAnime` and every other function in the
unit at 100%.
## Constructor call cleanup

`EditSetPlaceAnime` now has an active C++ definition that constructs its
`mgCFrame` member through typed placement new. Earlier constructor forms
changed MWCC code generation; the current object requires an integrated
comparison before the function's matching status can be stated.

## Constructor-backed allocations

`EditSetPlaceAnime` uses native placement construction of the temporary `CMapParts` in its guarded draft. The retail assembly remains active because that constructor has not matched the call schedule.

## October 8 merged-base constructor visibility

The guarded `EditSetPlaceAnime` draft makes the same natural inline
`CMapParts` constructor definition available that editmap already uses.
This reduces the pinned-profile comparison from 106/156 differing words
(0x1FC/0x270 bytes) to 2/156 (0x264/0x270; the retail tail is zero padding).
All instructions except the allocation-result branch/copy pair at +0xC0
and +0xC4 agree, including the frame and function-point initialization.
The constructor definition remains inside `NONMATCHING`, so it has no
active-unit effect.

Blocker: placement-new allocation-result scheduling. Keep the draft guarded
and reconsider when the dedicated constructor lane establishes a natural
form that branches on `v0` before the saved-pointer copy in the delay slot.
No shared-header change is required.

With this closer draft retained behind its guard, the complete editeff object
passes with 0x1C80 bytes and 265 resolved relocations; its coverage remains
27 matched functions and one guarded draft. The integrated allocated ELF
contents and inherited verifier output remain unchanged.
