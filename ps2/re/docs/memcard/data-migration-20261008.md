# Memory-card data migration

## Baseline

At `ab376093`, all 49 functions match. Baseline markers are 46 RODATA / 9
BSS. Refreshed objdiff credits 0/1,792 data bytes (`matched_data` is absent
from this unit's measures, meaning zero). The warm build reports PAL OK and
all 149 objects pass.

## Named operation state

`DngTreeSaveFlag` is a native file-static signed halfword; its two declared
bytes receive two zero piece-padding bytes. `NowProgramLoopNo` is the public
signed halfword initialized to -1, also with a two-byte alignment tail.
`SubGameOmakeTempBuffer` is the existing public byte-buffer pointer. Their
header declarations stay unchanged.

`memcard-named-state-{build,objects,metrics}.log` under `.private/dataC-r1/`
records PAL OK, 149/149 objects, and unowned hashes unchanged. Markers become
45/7.

## Costume and browser tables

`cosbit_table` is a file-static array of 34 `COSBIT_INFO` rows. Item numbers
0x6f–0x86 map to bits 0–23; 0x102–0x10b map to bits 24–33. The fourth byte
of every row is zero. The 0x88-byte table receives eight piece-padding
bytes. Both costume lookups now advance typed rows directly.

`MCBrowsetName` is a native three-region, four-category pointer table. Its
Japanese, American, and European titles retain their original Shift-JIS
bytes through octal escapes. `MCBrowserName_Offset` is a matching native
3×4 halfword array, with eight alignment-tail bytes after its 24-byte
payload. Regional selection and the formatted `%s` titles are unchanged.

Receipts `memcard-costume-table`, `memcard-browser-titles-fixed`, and
`memcard-browser-offsets` under `.private/dataC-r1/` each report PAL OK,
149/149 objects, and no unowned object changes. Markers become 30/7.
The rejected first browser-title substitution interpreted octal escapes
inside a regular-expression replacement; regenerating the source with
literal backslashes resolves that script error without changing values.

## Local aggregate templates

`MakeMemoryCardFileName` now initializes its 20-byte directory buffer and
19-byte filename buffer directly with their retail formats. `DeleteFile`
initializes its 64-byte local `darkcloud%d` buffer inside the successful
synchronization branch. `GetAllSaveFileInfo` initializes its 128-byte
save-directory search pattern at the original copy point. The anonymous
aggregate objects, extern declarations, and byte-array wrapper types are
removed; native compiler templates supply identical data and relocations.

`SetIconData` uses the SDK's `sceMcColor`, `sceMcVu0FVECTOR`, and
`sceMcColorF` types for four background colours, three light directions,
three light colours, and ambient colour. Their initialized templates remain
64/48/48/16 bytes. The retail routine copies just 16 bytes from each
array into the cleared icon descriptor, leaving its remaining entries zero;
that behavior is preserved. Icon filename fields are accessed by their
real `name` members instead of structure-address casts.

Receipts `memcard-filename-templates`, `memcard-icon-templates`,
`memcard-delete-template`, and `memcard-directory-template` each report
PAL OK, 149/149 objects, and unchanged unowned hashes. Markers become 22/7.

## Inline strings and native switches

The accepted string steps preserve `darkclonicle`, `dc2Ver4`, the legacy
`dc2Ver2` comparison, and the original diagnostic misspellings. Shared path,
filename, and version strings pool at their original addresses. Each step
has PAL, 149-object, and unowned-hash receipts under `.private/dataC-r1/`:

| Function | Receipt prefix |
| --- | --- |
| `MakeMemoryCardFileName` | `memcard-literals-MakeMemoryCardFileName` |
| `MakeMemoryCardAlbumName` | `memcard-literals-MakeMemoryCardAlbumName` |
| `Initialize` | `memcard-literals-Initialize` |
| `SetIconData` | `memcard-literals-SetIconData` |
| `Step` | `memcard-literals-Step` |
| `Write` (slash only) | `memcard-literals-Write-slash` |
| `MakeDir` | `memcard-literals-MakeDir` |
| `SaveToMc` | `memcard-literals-SaveToMc` |
| `LoadFromMc` | `memcard-literals-LoadFromMc` |
| `SaveOamkeFile` (directory only) | `memcard-literals-SaveOamkeFile-path` |
| `CheckOmakeFile` (wildcard only) | `memcard-literals-CheckOmakeFile-pattern` |
| `GetSaveFileInfoFromMc` | `memcard-literals-GetSaveFileInfoFromMc` |

Two string markers remain for genuine argument-order mismatches. Inlining
`at_1315__3` as `(const unsigned char *) "test"` in `Write` preserves the
0xfc-byte function but changes two masked words at +0x48/+0x4c: the filename
low-half load precedes the slot argument instead of following it. Casting to
mutable unsigned bytes also fails. Inlining `at_1954` as the bonus-file path
in `SaveOamkeFile` preserves its 0x4f8-byte size but changes two words at
+0x2a4/+0x2ac for the same argument-order reason. Its shared marker and
references in `LoadOmakeFile` and `CheckOmakeFile` are retained. The rejected
build receipts are `memcard-literals-Write`,
`memcard-literals-Write-mutable-cast`, and
`memcard-literals-SaveOamkeFile`. No scheduling helper or new local is added.

The existing `Step` and `MakeDir` switches supply their own `at_1230__3`
and `at_1456__3` tables. Each marker removal is checked separately in
`memcard-switch-at_<number>__3` receipts. Markers become 2 RODATA / 7 BSS.

## Native function-local state

`SearchMcType` owns a zero-initialized `static int old_format` recording the
card's initial format state. `MakeDir` owns `static int iconNo = -1`,
`SaveToMc` owns `static int test_write_num = 0`, and `GetAllSaveFileInfo`
owns `static int ReadFileNo = 0`. Their explicit externs and hand-written
initialization guard blocks disappear. MWCC naturally generates the same
three guards and all four data objects. Separate accepted receipts are
`memcard-local-old-format`, `memcard-local-icon-number`,
`memcard-local-write-counter`, and `memcard-local-read-slot`;
`memcard-local-statics-final` verifies the restored final source. Every
accepted step passes PAL, all 149 objects, and the unowned hash comparison.

Seven BSS markers remain solely for local-symbol binding. Removing only
`old_format_1242` leaves `SearchMcType` at 0x260 bytes with zero masked
instruction-word differences, but the current postprocessor leaves native
`old_format_532` unnamed in the retail layout. Removing only `init_1324`
leaves `MakeDir` at 0x5cc bytes with zero masked instruction-word differences,
but native `init_613` is likewise unbound. The canonical checker reports the
missing retail BSS piece, an unexpected unnamed piece, and unresolved targets.
The explicit markers permit the existing unique-basename local-BSS binder
and relocation-based guard binder to fold these native copies correctly.
The generated numeric suffixes are unstable compiler identities, so no
source-name or line-padding workaround is introduced.

Rejected receipts `memcard-local-old-format-marker-free-{build,check}.log`
and `memcard-local-icon-guard-marker-free-{build,check}.log` capture that
boundary. Both markers are restored before acceptance. A general marker-free
local-static/guard identity mapper is needed in the shared toolchain; this
lane makes no shared-tool edits.

## Costume count and completion-loop probe

`MC_COSTUME_COUNT` names the 34-entry table extent and both costume lookup
bounds. `memcard-costume-count` preserves PAL, all objects, and unowned hashes.

Removing the empty thirteen-iteration completion loop in
`GetAllSaveFileInfo` fails: its native size shrinks from 0x244 to 0x1f4,
with 17 differing masked words in the common prefix and 20 missing trailing
words. Retail retains the counted loop's instructions; the original loop is
restored. `memcard-completion-loop-cleanup-build.log` records the rejected
trial. No new loop, local, or scheduling helper is introduced.

## Final measurements

Final markers are **2 RODATA / 7 BSS**, versus **46 / 9**. All 49 functions
remain matched; none is promoted. The explicit final objdiff/progress refresh
credits **0/1,792** data bytes, unchanged from baseline. Source-only objdiff
does not apply the linked object's data naming, ordering, and piece-padding
normalization; the canonical object checker verifies the migrated bytes and
resolved relocations.

The two read-only markers are the `sceMcOpen` filename argument-order
blockers above. All seven BSS objects and guards are generated by native
C++ but retain markers for shared-tool binding. Private source-only
reproducer `.private/proposals/memcard-marker-free-local-bss-reproducer.patch`
removes those seven markers for the tooling lane; it is deliberately not an
accepted source change. No shared tooling, unowned file, or header is edited.

Final receipts under `.private/dataC-r1/` are `final-{build,objects,metrics}.log`,
`final-refresh.log`, `final-coverage.log`, `final-data.json`, and
`final-drawmeswin-source.log`. Coverage stays 6,754 matched / 108 guarded /
10 assembly-only / 0 fuzzy; all 289 functions across the four owned units
stay matched. `DrawMesWin`'s source body remains identical to `ab376093`.
