# menuop: reverse-engineering notes

Unit: manual menu (`CManualMenu`, `MenuManual*`), option menu (`CMenuOption`, `MenuOption*`), save/load
menu (`CSaveMenuClass`, `MenuSave*`, `SaveFileListDraw`, map-info save/restore), mini-game save menu
(`SubGameSave*`). No first-game counterpart (Dark Cloud 1 has no `CBaseMenuClass` menus).

## Header dependencies
- `menuop.hpp` includes `menusys.hpp` (base `CBaseMenuClass`), `savedata.hpp`
  (`SV_CONFIG_OPTION`, by value twice in CMenuOption), `scenesnd.hpp`
  (`CScene::BGM_STATUS`, by value in CManualMenu and CSaveMenuClass), and
  `memcard.hpp` (typed card and file information). These headers compile together.
- Layout verified by compiling against stubs (CBaseMenuClass = 0x10C bytes + vptr at 0x10C, sizeof
  0x110; SV_CONFIG_OPTION 0x40; BGM_STATUS 0x1C) with every field offset asserted.
- `SV_CONFIG_OPTION`: size 0x40 (`InitSV_CONFIG_OPTION` memsets 0x40, sets +0x14 = 1), owned by
  savedata. `CScene::BGM_STATUS`: 0x1C (GetActiveBgmStatus writes +0..+0x18; +4 is the BGM number,
  read as `bgm_status+4` for LoadBGM in MenuManualDraw / CSaveMenuClass::KeyStep).
- `ps2/src/menuop.cpp` includes `menuop.hpp`; the unit compiles with all drafts enabled.

## Vtables
`__vt__11CManualMenu` 0x37C580, `__vt__11CMenuOption` 0x37C560, `__vt__14CSaveMenuClass` 0x37C540,
each 0x20: 2 zero words + CBaseMenuClass's six (IsCreateObject, IsMakeObject, IsAskExtend,
ItemCmdAfter, InitEnd, ExitEnd), none overridden. No out-of-line ctor/dtor exists for any of the
three; the constructors are inlined into the *Init functions (`__nw__FUiP1(size, Alloc(...))`,
`__ct__14CBaseMenuClassFv`, store vptr at 0x10C, then member inits). The inline
constructors reproduce these stores in the order documented below.

## CManualMenu (0x178) -- `__nw(0x178)` in MenuManualInit
`MenuManualInit` keeps its typed C++ draft under `NONMATCHING`. The draft emits 0x518 bytes
where retail uses 0x510, moving the next function by 0x10 after alignment. The matching build
uses the retail assembly gap; other menuop functions still prevent whole-unit matching.
`MenuSaveInit` is native and exact with a loop initializing the two slot-form
pointers in `CSaveMenuClass`. The menuop object passes `check_objects.py` with
the remaining `MenuManualInit` and save-menu `KeyStep` guards.
Ctor order: vptr; `movie_stack.Init()`; select=0, top=0, list_y=400.0f (0x43C80000), cursor_jump=0,
pict_mode=0, pict_num=0, base 0x14 (s16)=0; `movie_stack.stSetBuffer(NULL)`.
- 0x110 select, 0x114 top: `MenuKeySelectCheck(.., &select, &top, 0, 0x2E, 10, 0)`; 46 entries, 10 lines.
  Entry `select` unlocks on `CheckBitFlagMenu(manual_boot_event_no[select])` or `CheckOmakeVtuto`.
- 0x118 BGM_STATUS saved before the movie, restored by SetActiveBgmStatus in MenuManualDraw.
- 0x134 pict_mode (entries 0x16/0x17 1-based load `pict` images instead of a movie),
  0x138 pict_num (6, or 3 for 0x17), 0x13C pict_page (L/R wrap). MnOnePictTex[pict_page] drawn.
- 0x140 mgCMemory movie_stack (Init in ctor; stSetBuffer to MenuArg.stack top before Load; its
  +0x1C/+0x24 accesses appear as 0x15C/0x164 in m2c).
- 0x170 float list_y (CalcMenu1 target `y - top*24`), 0x174 cursor_jump (MenuSetPos once).
- Uses base 0x0 (`mode`: 0 keys, 1 opening, 2 closing) and base 0x14 (`key_arg_no` in menusys's
  header) as the manual step: ManualMenuStep 0..4 (KeyStep switch 2, MenuManualDraw cases 2/3/4).

## CMenuOption (0x384) -- `__nw(900)` in MenuOptionInit
Ctor: vptr; for i<20: choice_num[i]=1, button[i][0..2]=0, value[i]=0, unk_2A4[i]=0 (unrolled x8 then
tail loop); list_y=400.0f; select=top=choice=0 (0x374/0x378/0x37C).
- 0x110 float list_y; 0x114 s32 choice_num[20] (2 for the first `config_option_num_i` lines,
  [5] = 3); 0x164 MENUFORMPARTS_TYPE* button[20][3] from form "Op_Switch" parts "INDEX%d"+"%d";
  0x254 s32* value[20] -> fields of `config`; 0x2A4 s32[20] only zeroed (unk).
- value map (option -> config offset): 0:+0 1:+4 2:+8 3:+0xC 4:+0x10 5:+0x14 6:+0x20 7:+0x1C
  8:+0x2C 9:+0x24 10:+0x28 11:+0x30; options 12..15 are the u8s at +0x34..+0x37 (set directly in
  KeyStep). +0x18 unused. Choosing option 7 = 1 forces *value[8] = 1; option 8 is locked and its
  buttons unlit while +0x1C == 1. Options 14/15 shown only when LanguageCode > 0. KeyStep prints
  MenuConfigPtr +0x36/+0x37 and sets CSound stereo from +0xC on close.
- 0x2F4 SV_CONFIG_OPTION config (copy of *MenuConfigPtr; Select resets via InitSV_CONFIG_OPTION;
  copied back to MenuConfigPtr on cancel/close); 0x334 config_backup (second copy, never read here).
- 0x374 select / 0x378 top (MenuKeySelectCheck max `config_option_num_i`, 9 lines), 0x37C choice
  (L/R clamp to choice_num[select]), 0x380 cursor_jump.
- DefaultButton sets rgba[0..2] (part +7..+9) to 0x40, EnableButton to 0x80.
- Opened with MenuArg.open_type 0x12 (MENU_OPEN_OPTION from title) uses TITLE_INITEND/PREEND_T.

## CSaveMenuClass (0x1A4) -- `__nw(0x1A4)` in MenuSaveInit
Ctor order: vptr; first_step(u8)=1; slot=0; list_jump(u8)=0; top=0; select=0; mode=0; dl_base=0;

  mc+0x914, SetFuncNo 6, phase 2), 0x32 load confirm, 0x33 loading, 0x34 "LOADEND" (fills
  MenuArg+0x3C..0x50 from memcard +0x8F8..0x908), 0x3C; within format page: 0, 0xA, 0x14.
- save_kind (0x130): 0 when the chosen file exists (overwrite), 1 new. EnvSetSave(kind): kind 1 ->
  SetFuncNo 3, phase 0xA, progress size - 0x1000; kind 0 -> SetFuncNo 6, phase 2. Also writes
  memcard +0x4CC = select.
- 0x13C save_kb = GetSaveDataSize(0)/1024, 0x140 check_kb = save_kb+3 (vs MC_CARD_INFO +0x14 free),
  0x138 need_kb = save_kb+4 (message volume).
- 0x144 card_ok = McCheckMCPs2 result stored in file list; 0x148 card_changed -> page 2 retry.
- 0x14C = CheckStartChapter8(GetSaveData()) (forced 0 in load modes), 0x150 save count.

## Globals (all `.sbss/.bss` symbols are LOCAL except MenuMapInfoSave -> declare `static` in .cpp)

  Declared `u8[0xC]` because the savedata struct's name is unknown; retype once savedata.hpp has it.
- MenuMapInfoSave_DngNo s16: saved CSaveData+0x1C5B4 (dungeon number). SaveMapInfo(dng) sets
  +0x1A1C = +0x1A18, +0x1A18 = GetDngMapNo(dng), +0x1C5B4 = dng. GetDngMapNo: dngmap_2627[7] names.

  mgCMemory (Init'd in __sinit), SaveFileList CDC2Mes*[13] (`__nw(0x2A50)` each), SubGameDataBgm
  CScene::BGM_STATUS (0x1C).
- .sdata statics: manual_list_mesclstbl s8[5] = {2,4,5,6,8} (MenuDCMsg/MenuMesForm indices of the 5
  list columns); config_option_num_i / config_option_num_f are BOTH float (14.0 or 16.0 if
  LanguageCode > 0). manual_boot_event_no s16[47] (.data).
- Local functions (static, keep in .cpp): InitMnOnePictTex, SetMCIconData, SubGameCFGAnalyze.

## Function notes
- The typed `CMenuOption` constructor produces an exact retail `MenuOptionInit`.
  `CSaveMenuClass` also produces an exact `MenuSaveInit`, using a loop over its
  actual slot-form array. `CManualMenu` reproduces the documented member stores
  but its guarded init still differs at the placement-new null branch and
  subsequent scheduling.
- Init signature `(mgCMemory *stack, int *tex_block, int open_type)`; open_type is
  MenuCommonInfo+0x50 (MenuOpenType) from NextMenuInit/MenuMainInit, or 7 / 0x1E from
  DngTreeMapKey / GyoraceMenuKey.
- *Key functions are `return Ptr->KeyStep();` (tail call), so they return int.
- `CManualMenu::KeyStep` matches retail, including the float argument setup
  for the movie BGM phase-3 `CalcMenuAdd` call.
- LocalFunc_AdjustScrlBar(parts[3], pos[2], size[2], top, line_num, show_num, jump): uses pos[1],
  size[1]; part +0x20 y, +0x28 h. Also called by editmenu's CRemovalMenu::KeyStep.
- SaveFileListDraw(int &tex_block, float *pos, int alpha): called from
  CMenuPosDataForm::MenuFormDraw (menudraw); `tex_block` is passed on to MenuReloadTexture(int&, int).
- SetDlInfoMsg(load, show): msg 0xC09 if load else 0xC08 on MenuDCMsg[7]; MenuMesForm[?] +1 = show.

## LocalFunc_AdjustScrlBar draft
The scrollbar helper divides the available height by total and visible lines, resizes the middle part, then positions the three parts in order. The typed C++ function matches retail.

## SaveFileListDraw draft
The save list draws 13 card slots in one primitive batch, with an extra marker for occupied slots. It then positions message lines and formats each occupied file’s play time from frames into hours and minutes. Europe uses ASCII digits and `sprintf`; other regions build digits with `GetMenuBigNum`. The typed C++ function matches retail.

## Save map and option indexing

`CSaveData::save_dungeon.stage_id` occupies the saved dungeon word at offset
0x1C5B4. Direct field access is semantically equivalent, but MWCC forms the
large address as `lui 2` plus a negative store offset; retail uses `lui 1`,
`ori 0xC5B4`, then a zero-offset store. `SaveMapInfo` and `ResetMapInfo`
therefore retain the explicit offset for exact matching. The three option
map buttons form a typed pointer array, but direct indexing changes
`CMenuOption::UpdateOptionForm` register allocation (99.78%).
The typed `loop_row[i]` variant keeps the 0x344-byte function size and changes
only the saved-register pairing in the three-button loop: retail uses `s3`
for the row base and `s2` for the byte offset, while MWCC assigns these in
the opposite order. Reordering declarations and loop increments leaves the
99.78% score unchanged.

## Remaining-function classification at 0abce37

The current unit has 36 functions: 33 match and these three retain their
`NONMATCHING` guards. The comparison below uses relocation-masked instruction
words over each manifest extent, not objdiff similarity percentages.

### MenuManualInit__FP9mgCMemoryPii — placement-new null branch

Retail is 0x510 bytes; the natural C++ draft is 0x518 bytes. At retail +0x98
(0x2C4518), `beqz v0` skips construction and `move s2,v0` occupies its delay
slot. The draft moves into s2 first, then branches on s2. Base construction,
vtable emission, and the embedded mgCMemory initialization consequently have
different scheduling. The current draft does not fit the retail extent.

This is the placement-new branch category reserved for the dedicated compiler
research lane. Keep the constructor and init guarded. Reconsider when that lane
provides a natural C++ declaration or compiler explanation that reproduces
branch-before-copy without hand-written vtable stores or instruction wrappers.

### MenuSaveInit__FP9mgCMemoryPii — placement-new null branch

The draft and retail extents are both 0x6A0; 245/424 masked words differ. The
first differing pair is at +0x68/+0x6C (0x2C9B48/0x2C9B4C): retail uses
`beqz v0` with `move s0,v0` in its delay slot; the draft copies into s0 and then
branches on s0. This shifts the inline base/derived initialization sequence by
one instruction through the allocation of CMemoryCardManager. The same store
order therefore does not imply a matching function. The message-window loop
has a separate placement-new call whose scheduling also differs.

Stop on the shared placement-new category. Reconsider after the dedicated lane
solves the branch/copy pattern, then compare the remaining allocation and loop
scheduling before attempting manual promotion.

### KeyStep__14CSaveMenuClassFv — control flow and stack layout

Baseline: 1291/1692 words differ, draft 0x1A2C, retail 0x1A70. With the
retained natural C++ corrections: 1189/1692 differ, draft 0x1A44. No guard has
been removed. All other 33 unit functions still match.

Retail loads MenuDCMsg[2] after CMemoryCardManager::Step. After FormStep, it
captures messages 4, 5 and 6 before StepMsg and the position calls. Those load
orders are significant across calls and are reflected in the draft. File-list
phase 7 is an explicit idle switch arm: retail compares it between phases 2 and
6 and branches to the shared page exit. Placing that arm after the phase-6
notice body reproduces the dispatch order. LR page jumps modify the existing
movement accumulator by two, and the file-read page clamps `top > 10` to 10.
The latter spelling reproduces retail's `slti at` comparison.

Entering the file list refreshes its messages in every menu mode. Expressing
that assignment once after the conditional load messages restores the retail
register allocation: Step result s7, error pointer s8, refresh s6, LR key spill
at stack +0xDC. The comma assignment inside the mode test changes those live
ranges despite giving the same boolean result.

Remaining differences include:

- Retail frame 0x1A0 versus draft 0x160. Both place the 13 file-info pointers
  at +0xE0 and the form coordinates at +0x120/+0x124. Retail's temporary arrays
  start at +0x168, while the draft's start at +0x128. The unreferenced interval
  +0x128..+0x167 does not establish a legitimate extra array or its element type;
  adding artificial padding or enlarging an array solely to reserve it is not
  supported by the evidence.
- The readiness tests after clamping the signed input-wait counter emit a
  relational result followed by a branch in retail (for example `slt`/`bnez`
  at +0xA18/+0xA1C); the draft emits `bgtz` directly. Changing only the ready
  predicate from `<= 0` to `< 1` produces identical instructions.
- Save/load message and page-exit blocks retain scheduling and branch-target
  differences; the shorter draft displaces later blocks. Matching initial
  register allocation is insufficient to establish a matching full body.

Park under control-flow/stack-layout reconstruction. Reconsider when an actual
local type or array extent explains the 64-byte stack interval, or when a
natural counter-condition structure supported by retail produces its boolean
materialization. Re-run the complete function diff after either finding;
remaining page scheduling must also reach zero before removing the guard.

For m2c, the generated retail function refers to two tables named
`at_2517__2` and `at_2518__2`, which its jump-table recognizer does not accept.
An analysis-only copy renaming those to `jtbl_at_2517__2` and
`jtbl_at_2518__2`, with their exact `.word` destinations from the corresponding
retail `__DATA.s` files expressed as local labels, allows the full function to
be decompiled. Generated assembly and shared headers need no changes.

## Save-menu constructor inline classification (2026-10-08)

`CSaveMenuClass` initializes its two actual `slot_form` entries in an ascending
loop. The optimizer unrolls it to the same NULL stores at +0x17C and +0x180;
all intervening form assignments and the three scrollbar-part assignments
retain their existing order and values. No base/member constructor calls are
added or removed. The constructor's inline-info classification is 3, verified
with the hash-pinned trace driver. This puts allocation assignment inside the
construction guard: `beqz v0` at caller +0x68, with `move s0,v0` at +0x6C.

Canonical native `MenuSaveInit__FP9mgCMemoryPii` has 0/424 differing words,
identical relocation kinds and the retail 0x6A0 size; plain-wibo
`draft.sh --diff` also reports zero differences. Only that function changes
in the full native draft comparison. Its guard/fallback are removed manually.
`MenuManualInit` and `CSaveMenuClass::KeyStep` retain their independent parks.

The full build retains i15's .text difference of 0x26 bytes, with every other
section and BSS end OK. Complete objects pass 147/149; nd_meswin and actscript
retain exactly their original single problem each. Against the accepted shop
change, only `menuop.cpp.o` changes its full-file hash; all 149 allocated-section
inventories stay identical. Coverage increases from 6,682/173/15/2 to
6,683 matched / 172 guarded / 15 asm-only / 2 fuzzy, without any matched function
losing its status. Receipts: `.private/receipts/ctor-final/save-promoted/`.
